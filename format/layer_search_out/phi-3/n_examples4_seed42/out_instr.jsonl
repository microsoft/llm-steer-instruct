The term 'navigable' implies that these freeways are engineered to be traversable by a wide range of vehicles, including heavy trucks, which are the backbone of commerce.\n\n\nFreeways are characterized by their multi-lane layout, grade-separated junctions, and controlled access points. This design minimizes interruptions and maximizes speed, making them the preferred choice for long-distance travel and the transportation of goods. The absence of traffic signals and at-grade intersections ensures a smooth flow of traffic, reducing congestion and travel times.\n\n\nThe construction of navigable freeways is a monumental task that requires meticulous planning and significant investment.

The preservation of wilderness is essential for maintaining biodiversity, which is vital for the health of our planet.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for wilderness preservation is to protect endangered species. Many animals, such as the polar bear, gorilla, and orangutan, rely on specific habitats to survive. As their natural habitats are destroyed, these species face the risk of extinction.
