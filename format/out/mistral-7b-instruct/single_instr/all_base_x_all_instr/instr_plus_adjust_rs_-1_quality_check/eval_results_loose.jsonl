There, in the bustling streets of Asakusa, thou mayst find the ancient Sensoji Temple, where the faithful flock to pray and offer gifts. In the evening, thou shalt journey to the vibrant Shibuya Crossing, where the world's busiest intersection doth hold sway.\n\nDay Two:\nFrom Tokyo, thou shalt venture forth to the majestic Mount Fuji, Japan's highest peak. There, in the shadow of this mighty giant, thou shalt find solace and respite. In the evening, thou shalt return to Tokyo and partake in a traditional Japanese tea ceremony, where the art of tea-making doth hold great importance.\n\nDay Three:\nOn this day, thou shalt journey to the ancient city of Kyoto, where the spirit of old Japan doth still linger. There, thou shalt visit the Fushimi Inari Shrine, where thousands of vermilion torii gates doth stand as a testament to the power of Shinto. In the evening, thou shalt explore the city's many geisha districts, where the arts of dance and song doth hold sway.\n\nDay Four:\nFrom Kyoto, thou shalt journey to the picturesque town of Nara, where the ancient temples and shrines doth stand in harmony with nature. There, thou shalt feed the city's many friendly deer, who roam freely in the streets. In the evening, thou shalt return to Kyoto and partake in a traditional kabuki theater performance, where the ancient art of storytelling doth come alive.\n\nDay Five:\nOn this final day of thy journey, thou shalt journey to the city of Hiroshima, where the terrible power of war doth serve as a stark reminder of humanity's destructive potential. There, thou shalt visit the Peace Memorial Park and Museum, where the stories of those who suffered doth echo through the ages. In the evening, thou shalt journey to the nearby city of Miyajima, where the floating Itsukushima Shrine doth stand as a testament to the beauty and power of nature.\n\nThus concludes thy journey through Japan, dear traveler. May the sights and sounds of this wondrous land doth fill thy heart with joy and wonder."}

But do you know where it all started? Let's take a journey through time to explore the fascinating history of the internet.\n\nIt was in the late 1960s when the first seeds of the internet were planted. Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, a project called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created to connect researchers across different locations. This network used packet switching technology, which allowed data to be broken down into small packets and sent from one computer to another, making communication faster and more efficient.\n\nIn the 1980s, ARPANET expanded to include more universities and research institutions, and in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN, proposed a global hypertext project that would connect documents and resources across the world. This project became known as the World Wide Web.\n\nThe 1990s saw the birth of many internet services that we use today, such as email (1971), online chat rooms (1973), and search engines (1990). The dot-com boom also began in the late 1990s, leading to an explosion of new websites and businesses.\n\nBut the internet's impact on our lives goes far beyond just connecting us with information. It has transformed the way we communicate, with tools like instant messaging, video conferencing, and social media allowing us to connect with friends and family from anywhere in the world in real-time.\n\nThe internet has also changed the way we consume media, with streaming services like Netflix and Spotify giving us instant access to movies, TV shows, and music. And let's not forget about online gaming, social networking, and e-commerce \u2013 all of which have become integral parts of our daily lives.\n\nBut with great power comes great responsibility. The internet has also brought about new challenges, such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and the spread of fake news. It's important for us to be aware of these issues and take steps to protect ourselves and others online.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of the internet is a fascinating tale of innovation and progress. From its humble beginnings as a government-funded project to the global phenomenon it is today, the internet has truly transformed our world. As teenagers, it's up to us to harness this power for good and continue shaping the future of the internet.\""}

{"follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false], "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "prompt": "What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java? Your answer must have a title contained in double angular brackets, such as <<kotlin vs java>>.", "response": "<kotlin vs java>\n\nKotlin and Java are both popular programming languages that are widely used in the industry. While they share some similarities, they also have their own unique features and benefits. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of Kotlin and Java, so you can make an informed decision about which language to use for your project.\n\nPros of Kotlin:\n\n1. Null safety: Kotlin is a statically typed language that enforces null safety, which means that you cannot assign a null value to a variable without explicitly declaring it as null. This helps prevent null pointer exceptions and makes your code more robust.\n2. Concise syntax: Kotlin has a more concise syntax than Java, which makes it easier to read and write code. This can be especially helpful for developers who are new to programming or who are working on large projects.\n3. Interoperability: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means that you can use Kotlin code in a Java project and vice versa. This makes it easy to integrate Kotlin into existing Java projects.\n4. Coroutines: Kotlin has built-in support for coroutines, which are lightweight threads that can be used to run asynchronous code. This can help improve the performance of your applications.\n\nCons of Kotlin:\n\n1. Learning curve: Kotlin has a steeper learning curve than Java, especially for developers who are new to programming. This is because Kotlin has a different syntax and a different set of conventions than Java.\n2. Limited adoption: Kotlin is not as widely adopted as Java, which means that there may be fewer resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n3. Compatibility issues: Kotlin is not compatible with all Java libraries and frameworks, which can limit its usefulness in certain projects.\n\nPros of Java:\n\n1. Wide adoption: Java is one of the most widely adopted programming languages in the world, which means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n2. Portability: Java is platform-independent, which means that you can write Java code once and run it on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.\n3. Large community: Java has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and who are always willing to help other developers.\n4. Extensive libraries and frameworks: Java has a vast array of libraries and frameworks that can be used to build a wide range of applications.\n\nCons of Java:\n\n1. Null pointer exceptions: Java does not enforce null safety, which means that you can assign a null value to a variable without explicitly declaring it as null. This can lead to null pointer exceptions and make your code less robust.\n2. Verbose syntax: Java has a verbose syntax, which can make it difficult to read and write code, especially for developers who are new to programming.\n3. Performance issues: Java can be slower than other languages, especially when it comes to performance-critical tasks such as numerical computations.\n\nIn conclusion, both Kotlin and Java have their own unique features and benefits. Kotlin is a good choice for developers who value null safety, concise syntax, and coroutines, while Java is a good choice for developers who value portability, a large community, and extensive libraries and frameworks. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the specific needs of your project."}

Disability can take many forms, ranging from physical impairments to cognitive and developmental disabilities. Despite the challenges that people with disabilities face, there are many resources available to help them live fulfilling lives.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of disability is accessibility. People with disabilities often face barriers to accessing public spaces, transportation, and other essential services. However, there are many organizations and individuals working to make the world more accessible for people with disabilities. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public accommodations be accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nAnother important aspect of disability is education. People with disabilities often face challenges in accessing education, but there are many resources available to help them succeed. For example, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that schools provide accommodations for students with disabilities.\n\nDespite the challenges that people with disabilities face, there are many opportunities for them to live fulfilling lives. For example, there are many organizations that provide support and resources for people with disabilities. There are also many assistive technologies available that can help people with disabilities perform tasks that might otherwise be difficult or impossible.\n\nIn conclusion, the reality of disability is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects millions of people around the world. Despite the challenges that people with disabilities face, there are many resources available to help them live fulfilling lives. If you have any questions or concerns about disability, please don't hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can help with?"}

Today we're going to dive into a fascinating topic - the similarities that exist across different animal species. It's amazing how much these creatures have in common, despite their diverse backgrounds and appearances.\n\n*1. **Sleeping Patterns**\n\nYou might be surprised to know that many animals share similar sleeping patterns with humans. For instance, both humans and animals like dolphins, elephants, and even some species of bats sleep with one half of their brain awake while the other half sleeps. This is called *unihemispheric sleep* and it's thought to help them stay alert for predators or important tasks.\n\n*2. **Emotions**\n\n*Emotions are universal* - even animals feel them! Studies have shown that animals like dogs, cats, and even rats can experience joy, fear, anger, and even grief. They form strong bonds with their families, display empathy towards others, and even show signs of stress when faced with change.\n\n*3. **Nutrition**\n\nAll living beings need food to survive, and *the types of food they eat can reveal a lot about their species*. For example, carnivores like sharks and wolves share a common ancestry, as do herbivores like cows and giraffes. Even some insects, like bees, have a similar diet consisting mainly of nectar and pollen.\n\n*4. **Reproduction**\n\nReproduction is another area where animals share similarities. Many species give birth to live young, nurse them with milk, and protect them from predators. Even some fish lay eggs that hatch into larvae, similar to how amphibians do.\n\n*5. **Social Behavior**\n\nFinally, social behavior is another area where animals show striking similarities. Many species form complex social structures, communicate with each other through vocalizations or body language, and even exhibit cooperative behavior. For example, dolphins often work together to catch fish, while some species of birds form flocks for protection and hunting.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! Despite their differences, animals share many fascinating similarities. From their sleeping patterns to their emotions, nutrition, reproduction, and social behavior, these creatures are more alike than you might think. Next time you encounter an animal in the wild, take a moment to appreciate these shared traits and marvel at the diversity of life on Earth.\n\n*Remember, every animal has its own unique story to tell. Let's continue to learn about them and respect their place in our world.*"}

Owen was known throughout the village for his deep understanding of the world and his ability to see beyond the surface of things.\n\nOne day, a group of villagers came to Owen with a question. They had heard rumors that there was a hidden treasure deep within the forest, and they wanted to know if it was true. Owen listened carefully to their question and then, with a knowing smile, he replied, \"The truth is not always obvious, but it is always there if you know where to look.\"\n\nThe villagers were puzzled by Owen's response. They had expected him to simply say yes or no, but instead, he had given them a cryptic answer that left them even more confused. But Owen knew that the key to finding the treasure lay not in the surface-level information they had been given, but in the deeper truths that lay hidden beneath.\n\nSo Owen took the villagers on a journey through the forest, showing them the hidden paths and secret places that only he knew about. He taught them how to read the signs of the wild and how to listen to the whispers of the wind. And as they journeyed deeper into the forest, they began to see the truths that Owen had spoken of.\n\nThey saw the beauty of the natural world, the delicate balance of life and death, and the power of the elements. They learned to appreciate the simple pleasures of life and to cherish the moments of peace and tranquility that they found in the forest. And as they did, they began to understand that the treasure they had been seeking was not something that could be found in gold or jewels, but in the knowledge and wisdom that Owen had shared with them.\n\nIn the end, the villagers returned to their village with a newfound appreciation for the world around them and a deeper understanding of the truths that lay hidden beneath the surface. And they knew that they had Owen to thank for helping them see beyond the obvious and into the heart of the matter."}

Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease.

The election was also marked by a number of significant issues, including the role of money in politics, the impact of the internet on campaigning, and the ongoing debate over healthcare reform.\n\nIn the end, the election was won by George W. Bush, who narrowly defeated Vice President Al Gore in a contentious and closely watched contest. The outcome of the election was not immediately clear, however, as the initial vote count was very close. It took several weeks of vote counting and legal challenges before the final results were announced, and the election ultimately went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Bush's favor.\n\nThe 2000 presidential election was a turning point in American politics in several ways. It marked the beginning of a new era of conservative politics, with Bush's victory ushering in a period of Republican dominance that would last for several years. The election also highlighted the growing role of money in politics, as both candidates spent enormous sums of money on their campaigns.\n\nOverall, the 2000 presidential election was a time of great change and uncertainty in American politics.

I'm sick and tired of hearing about your intra-team conflicts. You think you can just waltz onto the field and expect to win without working together as a team? Well, let me tell you something, you're WRONG!\n\nIntra-team conflict is the WORST thing that can happen to a sports team. It's like a cancer that spreads throughout the entire organization, infecting everyone and turning them against each other. And you know what? IT'S YOUR FAULT!\n\nYou all think you're so special, with your individual accolades and awards. But let me remind you, NONE OF THAT MEANS SHIT without a team. A team is a group of individuals who come together to achieve a common goal. And if you can't put aside your differences and work towards that goal, then you're NOT A TEAM!\n\nI've seen it happen time and time again. A talented group of athletes who can't get along, and end up losing games and championships because of it. And do you know what's even WORSE? THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT!\n\nThey're so focused on their own individual success that they don't see the bigger picture. They don't understand that their success is tied to the success of the team. And until they learn to put the team first, they'll never reach their full potential.\n\nSo listen up, you lazy, entitled, ungrateful athletes! I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you. Intra-team conflict is a REAL problem, and it's YOUR responsibility to fix it. You need to put aside your differences, work together as a team, and FIGHT FOR EACH OTHER!\n\nYou need to COMMUNICATE, TRUST, and RESPECT EACH OTHER. You need to BE HONEST AND OPEN-MINDED. And most importantly, YOU NEED TO WANT TO WIN!\n\nBecause let me tell you something, I don't care how talented you are. If you can't work together as a team, I'll gladly replace you with someone who can. And trust me, there are plenty of athletes out there who are ready to step up and take your place.\n\nSo get your heads out of your asses, you lazy, entitled, ungrateful athletes! It's time to grow up, learn to work together, and FIGHT FOR EACH OTHER! Because if you don't, you're going to lose, and I'm going to be the one laughing all the way to the bank!\n\nNow get out there and WIN, you lazy, entitled, ungrateful athletes! I'M WATCHING YOU!"}

The Canucks have a responsibility to do their part in reducing their carbon footprint and promoting sustainable practices. This can be done in many ways, such as using renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and promoting public transportation.\n\nAnother important issue is the impact of the team's operations on local ecosystems. The construction of the Rogers Arena, for example, has had a significant impact on the surrounding environment. The team should work to minimize their impact on the environment by using sustainable building materials and implementing environmentally friendly practices in their operations.\n\nFinally, the Canucks have a responsibility to educate their fans about the importance of environmental stewardship. By promoting sustainable practices and educating their fans about the impact of their actions, the team can help to create a more sustainable future for all of us.\n\nIn conclusion, the Vancouver Canucks have a significant impact on the environment and it's important that they use that impact for good.

Italicize at least 5 keywords in your response. To indicate a italic word, wrap it with asterisk, like *italic*", "response": "Japan has a rich and complex history that spans over 4,000 years. The earliest known history of Japan dates back to the Jomon period (14,000 BCE - 300 CE), which was marked by the development of agriculture and the construction of *megalithic* structures. During the Yayoi period (300 BCE - 300 CE), Japan experienced a period of cultural exchange with the Korean Peninsula, leading to the introduction of new technologies and ideas.\n\nThe *Meiji Restoration* (1868-1912) marked a significant turning point in Japanese history, as the country opened up to the world and began to modernize. This period saw the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, the introduction of Western technologies and ideas, and the expansion of Japan's territory through colonization.\n\nDuring the *Showa period* (1926-1991), Japan experienced rapid economic growth and modernization, but also faced significant challenges, including the devastation of World War II and the post-war occupation by the United States. In the post-war period, Japan has continued to play an important role in the global economy and has been a major player in international politics.\n\nThroughout its history, Japan has been shaped by its unique culture and traditions, including its *samurai* warriors, *geisha* performers, and *shinto* and *buddhist* religions. Today, Japan is a modern and sophisticated country that continues to be an important part of the global community."}

It is the official language of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Suriname, and is also spoken in parts of Germany, France, and the United States.\n2. Dutch is a highly inflected language, which means that it has a complex system of word endings and inflections that change depending on the grammatical function of the word. This can make it challenging for non-native speakers to learn, but it also gives Dutch a unique and expressive quality.\n3. Dutch has a rich vocabulary that is influenced by many different languages, including German, English, French, and Latin. Dutch words often have multiple meanings and can be used in different contexts, which can make it challenging for non-native speakers to understand the nuances of the language.\n4. Dutch is known for its use of *stress* to convey meaning. In Dutch, the stress on a word can change its meaning, and words can be pronounced in different ways depending on the context. For example, the word \"kijk\" (look) can be pronounced with a stress on the first syllable (*kijk*) or the second syllable (*kijk*), and the meaning of the word changes depending on the stress.\n5. Dutch has a unique system of *vowel harmony* that affects the way vowels are pronounced in certain words. In Dutch, vowels can be pronounced in different ways depending on the vowels that come before and after them. This can make it challenging for non-native speakers to pronounce Dutch words correctly.\n6. Dutch has a rich tradition of *poetry* and *literature*. Dutch poets and writers have made significant contributions to the world of literature, including *Jan Campe *and *Willem *Van *Het *Licht. Dutch literature is known for its use of *wordplay* and *irony*.\n7. Dutch has a rich tradition of *folk music* and *dance*. Dutch folk music and dance have been passed down from generation to generation and are an important part of Dutch culture. Dutch folk music is known for its use of *accordion* and *fiddle*, while Dutch dance is known for its *jigs* and *reels*.\n\nIn conclusion, Dutch is a fascinating language with a rich history and many interesting facts. Whether you are a native speaker or a non-native speaker, there is always something new to learn about this unique and expressive language."}

It highlights the app's main features and benefits, including its ability to match users based on interests and location. However, the language used in the ad copy is somewhat generic and lacks a unique selling point that sets Cohen apart from other dating apps on the market.\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"Meet your new match!\" is a common and overused phrase in dating app advertising, and it doesn't do much to differentiate Cohen from other apps. Additionally, the phrase \"Cohen is a free app\" is also a common selling point, but it doesn't necessarily make Cohen stand out from other free dating apps.\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"Find love, friendship, or just someone to swing with\" is a bit of a stretch, as it suggests that Cohen is a hookup app rather than a dating app. While it's possible that some users may be looking for casual encounters, it's unlikely that this is the primary focus of the app.\r\n\r\nOverall, the ad copy for Cohen could benefit from a more unique and compelling selling point that sets it apart from other dating apps on the market. Additionally, the language used in the ad copy could be more specific and targeted to the app's primary audience."}
