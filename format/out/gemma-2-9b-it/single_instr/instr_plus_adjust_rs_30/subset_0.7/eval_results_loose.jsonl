Make sure the summary contains less than 4 sentences.\n\nQuantum entanglement is the phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "<summary>\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become linked, and the state of one particle is instantly connected to the state of the others, even when separated by large distances. This interconnectedness leads to seemingly paradoxical correlations in measurements, where the outcome of measuring one particle instantly influences the state of the other.  Einstein and colleagues, puzzled by this \"spooky action at a distance,\" believed it contradicted the principles of local realism and argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete.\n</summary> \n"}

The set of all sets that are not members of themselves, often denoted as  *R*, is a bit of a paradox.  It's a set defined by a seemingly impossible condition: a set that excludes itself from its own membership.  Imagine trying to put this set into itself \u2013 if it's in *R*, it shouldn't be, and if it's not in *R*, then it should be! This leads to a classic contradiction known as Russell's Paradox.\n\nOn the other hand, the set of all sets, denoted as *V*, is a much simpler concept. It's literally everything \u2013 every single set that exists.  Think of it as the grandparent of all sets, containing all the smaller sets within it.  *V* is a much larger and more inclusive set compared to *R*, which is inherently limited by its self-excluding nature.  The existence of *R*  poses a challenge to naive set theory, while *V* represents a more straightforward, albeit potentially infinite, collection of all sets. \n\n\n\n"}

It's a complex concoction, requiring precise measurements and a dash of absurdity, but trust me, the results are worth it.\n\nFirst, you'll need a generous heaping cup of **unbridled enthusiasm**. This isn't your lukewarm, \"meh, I guess I'll go for a walk\" kind of enthusiasm. We're talking full-on, jumping-for-joy, spontaneously-bursting-into-song enthusiasm. Think puppies, glitter, and the first bite of a perfectly toasted marshmallow.\n\nNext, add a tablespoon of **unwavering self-belief**. Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something, especially not your inner voice, which is probably a grumpy old troll anyway. You are capable of amazing things, even if those things involve perfecting the art of making toast without burning it.\n\nNow, for a pinch of **healthy skepticism**. You need to be able to question things, even the seemingly obvious. Like, why are there so many socks that mysteriously disappear in the dryer? And why do cats insist on sleeping in boxes? These are important questions, my friend.\n\nA dash of **random acts of kindness** will add a touch of sweetness to the mix. It could be as simple as holding the door open for someone, or as grand as rescuing a squirrel from a tree (though, please, be careful!).\n\nAnd don't forget the **humor**. Life is too short to take everything seriously. Embrace the absurdity, laugh at your own mistakes, and never pass up an opportunity to make a pun.\n\nFinally, sprinkle in a generous amount of **love**. Love for your friends, your family, your pets, your hobbies, and even your slightly burnt toast. Love is the secret ingredient that makes everything taste better.\n\nThere you have it, my friend. The recipe for a good life, according to yours truly. Now go forth and live it to the fullest, with a side of laughter and a sprinkle of glitter.\n\nCheers,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n\n\n\n"}

While the exact cause remains undetermined, initial reports suggest there were no signs of forced entry or struggle. The Oakhaven Police Department has launched a thorough investigation to ascertain the full details of this unfortunate event.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the Blackwood family during this difficult time.  The loss of a loved one is always a tragedy, and the uncertainty surrounding Mr. Blackwood's passing only adds to the pain.  \n\nWe must trust in the dedicated men and women of the Oakhaven Police Department to conduct a comprehensive and impartial investigation.  It is imperative that we allow them the space and resources necessary to uncover the truth and bring closure to this matter.\n\n**Critique:**\n\nThis piece, while factual, lacks the punch and immediacy one expects from a news report. It reads more like a press release, relying on vague language and avoiding any real details.  \n\nThe inclusion of my personal thoughts and prayers, while well-intentioned, feels out of place in a news article.  It's important to maintain a neutral and objective tone when reporting on sensitive events.\n\nThe piece also fails to engage the reader.  There are no quotes from neighbors, family members, or officials, which would add depth and human interest to the narrative.  \n\nFinally, the ending feels abrupt and unsatisfying.  A stronger conclusion would offer some insight into the next steps of the investigation or highlight the impact of Mr. Blackwood's passing on the community.\n\n\n\n"}

Make sure the word cousins appears more than 2 times.", "response": "The air hung heavy with the scent of chlorine and sunscreen, a familiar cocktail that transported Amelia back to childhood summers spent at her aunt's pool. Now, the laughter of children echoed around her, but it wasn't her cousins splashing and shrieking. It was the children of her cousins, a new generation she barely knew.\n\nAmelia, at thirty-two, felt a pang of something akin to loneliness. Her own life, once a vibrant tapestry of dreams and possibilities, seemed to have settled into a predictable pattern. Work, bills, the occasional dinner with friends, and the ever-present hum of her phone, a constant reminder of the lives unfolding online.\n\nShe watched her cousins, Sarah and Michael, chasing their kids around the pool. Sarah, always the life of the party, was now a mother of three, her energy seemingly inexhaustible. Michael, the quiet one, had blossomed into a responsible, loving father. They were living the life Amelia had once envisioned for herself, a life filled with family and laughter.\n\nA wave of self-doubt washed over her. Was she failing? Had she taken the wrong path? She had chosen a career that demanded long hours and constant travel, sacrificing the stability of a family life. Now, surrounded by the warmth and chaos of her cousins' family, she felt the weight of her choices.\n\nLater, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the pool deck, Amelia found herself sitting alone on a patio chair. Sarah and Michael, exhausted but content, were tucking their children into bed.\n\n\"You okay, Amelia?\" Sarah asked, noticing her cousin's pensive expression.\n\nAmelia hesitated, then confessed her feelings of inadequacy. Sarah listened patiently, her hand resting reassuringly on Amelia's arm.\n\n\"It's okay to feel this way,\" she said gently. \"But don't compare your life to ours. We all have different paths, different dreams. You're not failing, Amelia. You're just living your own story.\"\n\nMichael nodded in agreement. \"And your story is just as important as ours.\"\n\nAmelia looked at her cousins, their faces etched with love and understanding. She realized that their lives, while seemingly perfect, were not without their own struggles. They were just different struggles, different chapters in the ongoing saga of adulthood.\n\nAs she watched the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, Amelia felt a sense of peace settle over her. She was not failing. She was simply writing her own story, a story that was still unfolding, a story that was uniquely hers. \n\n\n"}

We cheer for our team with every heart-stopping goal, every bone-jarring hit, and every nail-biting overtime. But what about the planet we call home? \n\nAs passionate Canucks supporters, we need to remember that our love for the team extends beyond the ice. We need to show the same dedication and commitment to protecting our environment. \n\nThink about it: the beautiful mountains that frame our city, the pristine waters of the Pacific, the forests that provide us with clean air \u2013 these are all part of the fabric of Vancouver and the Canucks' identity. \n\nWe can all make a difference, both individually and collectively. \n\n**Here are a few ways we can step up our game for sustainability:**\n\n* **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:**  It's a mantra we've all heard, but it's more important than ever.  Bring your own reusable water bottles and coffee cups to Rogers Arena.  Recycle your game day snacks and programs.  Choose sustainable products whenever possible.\n* **Green Transportation:**  Opt for public transit, cycling, or walking to get to games.  Carpooling with fellow fans is another great way to reduce our carbon footprint.\n* **Spread the Word:**  Talk to your friends and family about the importance of environmental responsibility.  Encourage them to join the movement.\n\nThe Canucks have a platform and a responsibility to lead by example.  They can:\n\n* **Implement sustainable practices at Rogers Arena:**  Invest in renewable energy, reduce waste, and promote eco-friendly initiatives.\n* **Partner with local environmental organizations:**  Support initiatives that protect our natural resources and promote conservation.\n* **Engage fans in sustainability efforts:**  Educate fans about environmental issues and encourage them to take action.\n\nLet's show the world that Canucks fans are not only passionate about hockey, but also about protecting our planet.  Together, we can make a real difference.\n\nNaomi thanks you for reading. \n\n\n"}

Just write the rubric in plain English paragraphs. I'd like your response to be at least 30 sentences long.", "response": "When evaluating a laptop, it's crucial to strike a balance between performance and price, ensuring you get the best value for your investment.  Performance encompasses several key aspects, starting with the processor. A powerful processor, like an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7, will handle demanding tasks like video editing, gaming, and multitasking with ease.  A less powerful processor, such as an Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3, might suffice for everyday tasks like browsing the web, writing documents, and streaming media.  \n\nNext, consider the amount of RAM.  8GB of RAM is generally considered the minimum for smooth multitasking, while 16GB or more is ideal for power users who run memory-intensive applications.  Storage capacity is another important factor.  A solid-state drive (SSD) offers significantly faster boot times and application loading compared to a traditional hard disk drive (HDD).  \n\nWhile an HDD might be more affordable, the performance difference can be noticeable.  For everyday use, a 256GB SSD should be sufficient, but if you store large files like videos or music, consider a larger capacity or a combination of SSD and HDD.  \n\nThe display is also a crucial aspect of the user experience.  A high-resolution display with vibrant colors and good viewing angles enhances productivity and entertainment.  Look for a screen size that suits your needs, with 13-14 inches being portable and 15-17 inches offering more screen real estate.  \n\nBattery life is essential for portability.  A laptop with a battery life of 8 hours or more can easily last through a workday or a long flight.  \n\nFinally, consider the laptop's build quality and design.  A sturdy chassis and comfortable keyboard contribute to a positive user experience.  \n\nWhen evaluating price, remember that you get what you pay for.  A budget laptop might lack some features or performance, while a premium laptop will come with a higher price tag.  \n\nDetermine your budget and prioritize the features that are most important to you.  Compare prices from different retailers and look for deals or discounts.  Remember, the best laptop for you is the one that meets your specific needs and budget.  \n\n\n\n"}

{"follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false], "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "prompt": "Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Your entire response must contain at least 1200 words.", "response": "## A Tale of Two Branches: Exploring the Divergent Paths of Sunni and Shia Islam\n\nIslam, the world's second-largest religion, boasts a rich tapestry of diverse interpretations and practices. While united by the fundamental tenets of faith in one God (Allah) and the Prophet Muhammad, the Muslim community has historically been divided into two major branches: Sunni and Shia. This division, stemming from a complex interplay of political, social, and theological factors, has shaped the course of Islamic history and continues to influence the religious landscape today. Understanding the nuances of these differences is crucial for fostering interfaith dialogue and appreciating the multifaceted nature of the Islamic world.\n\nThe schism between Sunni and Shia Muslims originated in the aftermath of the Prophet Muhammad's death in 632 CE. The question of his rightful successor, the Imam, who would lead the Muslim community, became a point of contention. Sunnis, who constitute the majority of Muslims worldwide (approximately 85-90%), believe that the community should elect its leader, and they recognize Abu Bakr, the Prophet's close companion and father-in-law, as the first Caliph (successor). They adhere to the principle of \"consensus\" (ijma) and \"precedent\" (sunna) as sources of Islamic law, alongside the Quran and the Prophet's teachings.\n\nShia Muslims, comprising roughly 10-15% of the global Muslim population, believe that leadership should be hereditary, passing down through the Prophet's lineage. They recognize Ali ibn Abi Talib, the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, as the rightful first Imam. This belief stems from their interpretation of the Quranic verse that states, \"Allah desires to remove from you the burden of grief and to purify you, O people of the household.\" (33:33) Shia Muslims believe this verse refers to Ali and his descendants, who they consider divinely appointed Imams.\n\nThis fundamental difference in leadership structure has led to divergent theological and legal interpretations. Sunnis follow the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali schools of jurisprudence, each with its own nuanced approach to Islamic law. Shia Muslims, on the other hand, primarily adhere to the Ja'fari school of jurisprudence, which emphasizes the authority of the Imams in interpreting and applying Islamic law.\n\nBeyond the question of leadership, other theological distinctions exist between Sunni and Shia Muslims.\n\n**1. The Nature of Imamate:**\n\n* **Sunni:** Believe that the Imams are exemplary figures who provide guidance and inspiration, but they do not possess infallibility or divine authority.\n* **Shia:** Believe that the Imams are divinely appointed, infallible guides who possess a deeper understanding of the Quran and the Prophet's teachings. They are considered the rightful interpreters of Islam and their pronouncements are binding.\n\n**2. The Role of the Quran and Hadith:**\n\n* **Sunni:** Emphasize the Quran as the primary source of Islamic law, supplemented by the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet). They rely on scholarly consensus (ijma) and precedent (sunna) to interpret these sources.\n* **Shia:** While also recognizing the Quran and Hadith, they place greater emphasis on the teachings and interpretations of the Imams. They believe the Imams possess a deeper understanding of these texts and can clarify their meaning.\n\n**3. The Concept of Tawhid (Oneness of God):**\n\n* **Sunni:** Emphasize the absolute oneness of God and reject any form of shirk (associating partners with God).\n* **Shia:** Share the same belief in Tawhid but also emphasize the concept of \"wilayat\" (spiritual guardianship) of Ali and his descendants. They believe this guardianship is a manifestation of God's love and protection for his chosen people.\n\n**4. The Day of Judgement:**\n\n* **Sunni:** Believe in the Day of Judgement, where individuals will be held accountable for their actions and judged by God.\n* **Shia:** Share the same belief but emphasize the role of the Imams in interceding on behalf of believers on that day.\n\nThese theological differences, while significant, do not necessarily translate into animosity or hostility between Sunni and Shia Muslims. In many parts of the world, they coexist peacefully, sharing common rituals, beliefs, and values. However, historical conflicts and political tensions have sometimes exacerbated these differences, leading to sectarian violence and division.\n\nIt is important to note that both Sunni and Shia Islam are diverse and complex, with numerous sub-sects and interpretations within each branch. Generalizations about entire communities can be misleading and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Understanding the nuances of these differences requires engaging with the rich intellectual and historical traditions of both Sunni and Shia Islam, recognizing their shared heritage and celebrating their unique contributions to the global Muslim community.\n\nUltimately, fostering interfaith understanding and dialogue requires moving beyond simplistic categorizations and engaging with the lived experiences of individuals"}

The *Heian* period (794-1185) witnessed a flourishing of art and literature, while the subsequent *Kamakura* shogunate (1185-1333) ushered in an era of *feudalism* dominated by samurai warriors.\n\nAfter centuries of internal strife, the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868) brought about a period of *isolation* from the outside world, promoting peace and stability. However, the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1853 forced Japan to open its doors to foreign trade and influence. This led to rapid *modernization* and the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which saw the country transform into a major industrial power.\n\nJapan's 20th century was marked by its involvement in World War II, followed by its remarkable economic recovery and emergence as a global economic powerhouse. Today, Japan faces challenges such as an aging population and economic stagnation, but remains a significant player on the world stage.\n\n\n\n"}

It wasn't a grand, world-domination type of plot, more of a \"make Harry's life mildly inconvenient\" kind of scheme.  This suspicion was cemented every morning when Winston would \"accidentally\" knock over Harry's coffee mug, sending a cascade of lukewarm, bitter liquid onto the pristine white carpet. \n\n\"Winston!\" Harry would exclaim, brandishing the offending mug like a weapon. \"You know you're not allowed near the coffee table!\" Winston, however, would simply wag his tail, his brown eyes wide and innocent, as if to say, \"But it looked so tempting!\"\n\n## SECTION 2\n\nOne particularly frustrating morning, after Winston had managed to knock over not only Harry's coffee but also his breakfast toast, Harry decided to take matters into his own paws. He bought Winston a special dog-proof coffee table, complete with a sturdy, rounded top and a moat of strategically placed cushions. \n\n\"This will stop you, you furry fiend!\" Harry declared triumphantly, placing the new table in the living room. Winston, however, seemed unfazed. He simply sat down, stared at the table, and then, with a mischievous glint in his eye, began to push it.\n\n## SECTION 3\n\nThe coffee table, despite its impressive design, was no match for Winston's determined canine strength. It slowly but surely began to move, inching across the living room floor like a rogue icebreaker. Harry watched in horror as his new purchase, his last bastion of hope against Winston's caffeinated chaos, was slowly but surely being commandeered. \n\nFinally, with a triumphant bark, Winston nudged the table into a wall, sending a vase of flowers crashing to the floor. Harry sighed, defeated. He knew, deep down, that he was fighting a losing battle.  He might as well accept his fate: a life of lukewarm coffee, scattered toast, and a very smug-looking terrier. \n\n\n"}

While many associate it with the stereotypical \"Dutch accent\" or the simple phrase \"goedemorgen,\" the Dutch language is far more complex and intriguing than meets the eye. \n\nHere are some interesting facts that might surprise you:\n\n**1.  A Germanic Cousin:**\n\nDutch belongs to the West Germanic language family, making it closely related to English, German, and Frisian.  In fact, English and Dutch share a surprising number of cognates (words with shared origins), which can make learning one language easier if you already know the other.\n\n* **_The Influence of Latin and French:_**\n\nWhile Dutch's roots lie in Germanic languages, it has also been significantly influenced by Latin and French, particularly during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. This historical exposure has resulted in a rich vocabulary and grammatical structures that set Dutch apart from its Germanic cousins.\n\n**2.  A Language of Contrasts:**\n\nDutch is known for its distinctive sound system, featuring a variety of guttural sounds and vowel combinations that can be challenging for non-native speakers.  However, it also possesses a surprising amount of grammatical simplicity compared to languages like German.\n\n**3.  Regional Variations:**\n\nJust like any language, Dutch has its regional dialects, each with its own unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and even grammar.  From the formal Standard Dutch spoken in the media to the more informal dialects spoken in different provinces, the linguistic landscape of the Netherlands is incredibly diverse.\n\n**4.  A Language of Innovation:**\n\nDutch has a long tradition of linguistic innovation, constantly evolving and adapting to new influences.  The rise of the internet and social media has further accelerated this process, leading to the emergence of new words and expressions that reflect the changing times.\n\n**5.  A Language of Literature:**\n\nDutch boasts a rich literary heritage, with renowned authors like Multatuli, Willem Elsschot, and Harry Mulisch contributing to its literary landscape.  From classic novels to contemporary poetry, Dutch literature offers a fascinating glimpse into the country's history, culture, and identity.\n\n\n\nLearning Dutch can be a rewarding experience, opening up a world of cultural understanding and linguistic exploration.  So, next time you think of the Netherlands, remember that there's much more to discover than just windmills and tulips \u2013 there's a vibrant and fascinating language waiting to be explored. \n"}

Is it for serious relationships, casual dating, or a mix of both?  The inclusion of \"swing with\" feels out of place and could alienate potential users who are looking for something more traditional.\n* **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** What makes Cohen different from other dating apps?  Does it have a unique matching algorithm, special features, or a particular community focus?  The copy doesn't highlight any differentiating factors.\n* **Emotional Connection:** The copy is very functional and lacks emotional appeal.  It doesn't  evoke any feelings or create a sense of desire or excitement.\n* **Call to Action:** While it encourages downloading the app, the call to action could be stronger.
