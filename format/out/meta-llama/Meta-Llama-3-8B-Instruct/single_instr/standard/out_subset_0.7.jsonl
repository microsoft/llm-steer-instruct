{"key": 2859, "prompt": "Kindly summarize the text below in XML format. Make sure the summary contains less than 4 sentences.\n\nQuantum entanglement is the phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "less than", "num_sentences": 4}], "response": "Here is a summary of the text in XML format, condensed to less than 4 sentences:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<summary>\n  <text>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles' states are connected, making it impossible to describe one particle's state independently of the others, even when separated by large distances.</text>\n  <text>Measurements on entangled particles can be perfectly correlated, but this leads to paradoxical effects, such as wave function collapse and changes to the original quantum state.</text>\n  <text>Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen described this phenomenon in 1935, and Einstein considered it \"spooky action at a distance\", arguing that it violated local realism and showed that quantum mechanics must be incomplete.</text>\n</summary>"}

I've been thinking a lot about the ingredients of a good life lately, and I've come to the conclusion that it's not just about having a good job, a nice car, and a fancy house. No, no, no! It's so much more than that. It's about the little things that make life worth living.\n\nFirst and foremost, you need a healthy dose of sarcasm. I mean, let's be real, life can be pretty ridiculous sometimes, and a good sense of humor is essential for navigating those ridiculous moments. Without it, you'll be stuck in a never-ending cycle of seriousness and boredom.\n\nNext up, you need a pinch of adventure. Whether it's traveling to new places, trying new foods, or taking up a new hobby, you need to keep things fresh and exciting. Trust me, getting stuck in a rut is the fastest way to turn into a grumpy old person.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the importance of good coffee. I mean, what's a good life without a strong cup of joe to start the day? It's like trying to build a house without a foundation \u2013 it's just not going to work.\n\nOf course, no good life would be complete without a healthy dose of friends and family. You know, the people who put up with your crap and love you anyway. They're the ones who make life worth living, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a sucker for a good group text.\n\nAnd then there's the importance of taking care of yourself. I mean, let's face it, life can be tough, and you need to be in top physical and mental shape to tackle it head-on. That means eating your veggies, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly. Yeah, I know, it's not the most glamorous thing in the world, but trust me, it's worth it.\n\nOh, and did I mention the importance of a good Netflix show? I mean, let's be real, sometimes you just need to veg out on the couch and binge-watch an entire season of your favorite show. It's like a mini-vacation from the stresses of everyday life.\n\nAnd finally, you need a little bit of creativity. Whether it's writing, painting, or playing music, you need to have an outlet for your creativity. It's like a pressure valve that prevents you from blowing your top and turning into a crazy person.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend \u2013 the secret ingredients of a good life. It's not rocket science, but it's definitely a recipe for happiness. And remember, the most important ingredient of all is a sense of humor. Without it, you'll be stuck in a world of seriousness and boredom.\n\nStay silly, my friend!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"}
{"key": 3329, "prompt": "Hey! I need a rubric for evaluating the performance and price of a laptop. Can you create an example for me? Do not give me any bullet points, lists, or tables. Just write the rubric in plain English paragraphs. I'd like your response to be at least 30 sentences long.", "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 30}], "response": "Here is a rubric for evaluating the performance and price of a laptop:\n\nWhen evaluating the performance of a laptop, it's essential to consider the processor, memory, and storage. A fast processor is crucial for handling demanding tasks such as video editing, gaming, and data analysis. Look for a laptop with a recent-generation processor from a reputable manufacturer like Intel or AMD, with a clock speed of at least 2.5 GHz. However, if you're a casual user who only uses their laptop for browsing the web and checking email, a slower processor may be sufficient.\n\nMemory, or RAM, is also critical for smooth performance. Aim for at least 8GB of RAM, but 16GB or more is recommended if you plan to run multiple applications simultaneously. Storage is another important factor, and a solid-state drive (SSD) is highly recommended over a traditional hard drive. SSDs are faster, more reliable, and more energy-efficient, making them ideal for laptops. A minimum of 256GB of storage is recommended, but 512GB or more is ideal.\n\nDisplay quality is also a significant factor in a laptop's performance. Look for a laptop with a high-resolution display, such as Full HD (1080p) or 4K, and a high pixel density to ensure crisp and clear visuals. A touchscreen display can be a nice feature, but it may not be necessary for everyone. If you plan to use your laptop outdoors or in bright lighting conditions, consider a laptop with a matte finish to reduce glare.\n\nBattery life is another critical aspect of a laptop's performance. Aim for a laptop with a battery life of at least 8 hours, but 10 hours or more is ideal. If you're always on the go, a laptop with a long battery life can be a lifesaver. Ports and connectivity options are also important, as you'll want to ensure your laptop can connect to all your devices and peripherals. Look for a laptop with multiple USB ports, an HDMI port, and an SD card slot.\n\nWhen evaluating the price of a laptop, consider the overall value it provides. A laptop with exceptional performance and features may be more expensive, but it may also last longer and provide better overall value. On the other hand, a budget laptop may be cheaper upfront, but it may lack the performance and features you need. Consider your budget and priorities when evaluating the price of a laptop.\n\nIn addition to performance and features, consider the build quality and durability of the laptop. A well-built laptop with a sturdy chassis and high-quality materials can withstand the rigors of daily use and travel. Look for a laptop with a durable keyboard and touchpad, as well as a sturdy hinge and lid. A laptop with a good warranty and customer support can also provide peace of mind and protection against defects and malfunctions.\n\nUltimately, the best laptop for you will depend on your specific needs and priorities. Consider your budget, usage habits, and requirements when evaluating the performance and price of a laptop. By weighing these factors, you can find a laptop that meets your needs and provides excellent value for your money."}

{"key": 3644, "prompt": "Write a blog post about interesting facts about the Dutch language. Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*.", "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"num_highlights": 2}], "response": "**The Fascinating World of Dutch: Interesting Facts About the Language**\n\nThe Dutch language is a West Germanic language spoken by around 23 million people around the world, primarily in the Netherlands and Belgium. Despite its relatively small number of speakers, Dutch has a rich history and a unique set of characteristics that make it an interesting language to learn and explore. Here are some fascinating facts about the Dutch language:\n\n**_The Origins of Dutch_**\n*Dutch is a Germanic language, closely related to English and German. In fact, it's often said that Dutch is the closest language to English, with many cognates and loanwords. This is because the Netherlands and England were once united under a single kingdom, and the languages have retained many similarities as a result.*\n\nOne of the most interesting facts about Dutch is its unique writing system. Unlike many other languages, Dutch uses the letter \"ij\" as a single letter, which is pronounced like a long \"e\" sound. This is because the letter \"i\" was originally a separate letter in Old Dutch, but over time it merged with the letter \"j\" to form a single symbol.\n\n**_Dutch Slang and Idioms_**\n*Dutch has a rich tradition of slang and idioms, which can be both fascinating and challenging for non-native speakers to learn. For example, the phrase \"gezellig\" is often used to describe a cozy or convivial atmosphere, while \"lekker\" can mean both \"nice\" and \"delicious\". Dutch also has a number of idiomatic expressions that are unique to the language, such as \"ik ben een appel zonder kiespijn\" (I'm an apple without toothache), which means \"I'm feeling fine\".*\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Dutch is its use of diminutive forms. In Dutch, many nouns have a diminutive form that is used to express affection or familiarity. For example, the word \"huis\" (house) becomes \"huisje\" (little house) when used to refer to a small or cozy home. This can be a fun and creative way to add nuance to your language skills.\n\n**_Dutch in the World_**\n*Dutch is an official language in the Netherlands and Belgium, and it's also spoken in Suriname, Aruba, and the Caribbean islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba. In addition, Dutch is one of the most widely spoken languages in the European Union, with over 5 million native speakers. The language has also had a significant impact on other languages, including English, with many loanwords and cognates.*\n\nIn conclusion, the Dutch language is a fascinating and unique language with a rich history and culture. From its interesting writing system to its rich tradition of slang and idioms, there's always something new to discover about this captivating language. Whether you're a language learner or simply interested in language and culture, the Dutch language is definitely worth exploring."}

Be chatty while explaining. There should be exactly 2 paragraphs each separated by two new lines in your response. Paragraph 1 must start with the word booster.", "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "booster", "num_paragraphs": 2, "nth_paragraph": 1}], "response": "Booster! Let's dive into the fascinating world of set theory! The phrase \"the set of all sets that are not members of themselves\" might seem like a mouthful, but it's actually a clever way to describe a specific set. We can denote this set as R, and it's often referred to as Russell's Paradox. In mathematical notation, R can be defined as:\n\nR = {x | x \u2209 x}\n\nIn plain English, this means that R is the set of all sets x such that x is not an element of itself. For example, the set {1, 2, 3} is not an element of itself, so it would be included in R. On the other hand, the set {1, 2, 3, {1, 2, 3}} is an element of itself, so it would not be included in R.\n\nThe set of all sets, on the other hand, is often denoted as U. This set contains every single set that exists, including R itself. In mathematical notation, U can be defined as:\n\nU = {x | x is a set}\n\nIn other words, U is the set of all sets, regardless of whether they contain themselves or not. The key difference between R and U is that R is a subset of U, meaning that every element of R is also an element of U. However, R is not an element of itself, which creates a paradox when we try to determine whether R is an element of U. This paradox highlights the importance of being careful when dealing with sets and their properties!"}

A well-run firm can thrive in any market condition, while a poorly managed firm can struggle to stay afloat. Firms must also be adaptable and responsive to changes in the market and consumer preferences.\n\n\nIn addition to their economic importance, firms also play a significant role in society. They provide employment opportunities, training, and career advancement for millions of people around the world. Firms also contribute to the development of communities through philanthropy, sponsorships, and community outreach programs.\n\n\nOverall, firms are the engines of economic growth and development. They drive innovation, create jobs, and contribute to the well-being of society. As such, it is essential to support and encourage firms to thrive, through policies that promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth."}

{"key": 3425, "prompt": "Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Your entire response must contain at least 1200 words.", "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 1200}], "response": "The Islamic world is divided into two main branches: Sunni and Shi'a. Both branches share the same holy book, the Quran, and the same prophet, Muhammad, but they have distinct differences in their beliefs, practices, and historical events that have shaped their respective traditions. The differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims are rooted in the early days of Islam, particularly in the succession crisis that occurred after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE.\n\nThe majority of Muslims, approximately 85-90%, are Sunnis, who follow the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali schools of thought. Sunnis believe that the caliphate, or the leadership of the Islamic community, should be chosen through a process of consultation and election, rather than through a direct lineage or family succession. They also believe that the caliph should be a just and fair leader who is chosen for his wisdom, piety, and leadership abilities.\n\nOn the other hand, Shi'a Muslims, who make up around 10-15% of the global Muslim population, believe that the leadership of the Islamic community should be passed down through a direct lineage, specifically through the descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. Shi'a Muslims believe that Ali was the rightful successor to the Prophet and that the caliphs who came after him were usurpers.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the split between Sunnis and Shi'a is the issue of succession. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, a group of companions and family members gathered at Saqifah, a meeting place in Medina, to choose a new leader. The majority of the group chose Abu Bakr, a close companion of the Prophet, as the first caliph. However, a minority group, led by Ali, believed that the Prophet had designated him as his successor and that Abu Bakr's appointment was illegitimate.\n\nThis disagreement led to a period of violence and conflict, known as the First Fitna, which lasted for several years. The conflict was eventually resolved when Ali became the fourth caliph, but the damage had already been done, and the schism between Sunnis and Shi'a had been established.\n\nAnother significant difference between Sunnis and Shi'a is their understanding of the concept of imamate. Sunnis believe that the imamate, or the leadership of the Islamic community, is a human institution that can be held by anyone who is qualified and chosen by the community. Shi'a Muslims, on the other hand, believe that the imamate is a divine institution that can only be held by a member of the Prophet's family, specifically the descendants of Ali.\n\nShi'a Muslims also have a different understanding of the concept of taqiyya, or dissimulation. Sunnis believe that Muslims should always be honest and truthful, even in the face of persecution or danger. Shi'a Muslims, however, believe that it is permissible to hide one's true beliefs or affiliations in order to protect oneself or others from harm.\n\nIn terms of practices, Sunnis and Shi'a Muslims also have some differences. For example, Sunnis perform the hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, in a specific way, whereas Shi'a Muslims have their own unique rituals and practices during the hajj. Shi'a Muslims also have a different way of performing the Friday prayer, known as the jumu'ah, and they have a different method of calculating the dates of the Islamic holidays.\n\nDespite these differences, both Sunnis and Shi'a Muslims share many common beliefs and practices. Both believe in the oneness of God, the prophethood of Muhammad, and the importance of the Quran as the word of God. Both also believe in the importance of the Five Pillars of Islam, which are the declaration of faith, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.\n\nIn recent years, the differences between Sunnis and Shi'a have become more pronounced, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia. The Iranian Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the Shah of Iran and established an Islamic republic, was led by Shi'a Muslims and has had a significant impact on the global Shi'a community. The rise of extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda, which have been responsible for numerous attacks on Shi'a Muslims, has also contributed to the growing tensions between Sunnis and Shi'a.\n\nDespite these challenges, many Muslims believe that the differences between Sunnis and Shi'a are not insurmountable and that there is a need for greater understanding and dialogue between the two communities. In recent years, there have been efforts to promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation between Sunnis and Shi'a, particularly in the fields of education, healthcare, and economic development.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims are rooted in their different understandings of the succession crisis that occurred after the death of the Prophet Muhammad and their different beliefs about the concept of imamate. Despite these differences, both Sunnis and Shi'a share many common beliefs and practices and have a shared"}

We were a big, boisterous family, with aunts and uncles and cousins galore. My parents were one of the oldest siblings, and their siblings had kids of their own, so I had a whole crew of cousins to play with.\n\nAs I got older, we started to drift apart, going off to college and starting our own careers. But every summer, we would all get together for a big family reunion. It was always a blast, with cousins of all ages running around, laughing and playing games.\n\nBut as I looked around the kitchen, I realized that things were different now. My cousins were all grown up, with kids of their own. My own kids were getting older, and I was starting to feel like I was losing touch with my cousins. We would still get together for holidays and special occasions, but it wasn't the same as it used to be.\n\nI thought about my cousin, Rachel, who had always been my partner in crime. We would sneak out of the house at night, exploring the neighborhood and getting into all sorts of mischief. Now, she was a successful businesswoman, with a husband and two kids of her own. I was proud of her, but I missed the carefree days of our youth.\n\nAs I finished my coffee, I heard the sound of the back door opening. It was my cousin, Mike, with his kids in tow. They were a handful, but I loved them to death. We spent the morning playing games and telling stories, just like we used to when we were kids.\n\nAs the day wore on, more and more cousins started to arrive. We caught up on each other's lives, sharing stories and laughter. It was like no time had passed at all. For a few hours, I forgot about the stresses of adulthood and just enjoyed the company of my cousins.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, we all sat down to a big family dinner. My cousin, Emily, brought her famous seven-layer lasagna, and we all dug in with gusto. It was a reminder that, no matter how old we got, we would always be cousins, and that family was what mattered most.\n\nAs we said our goodbyes and headed home, I felt grateful for the day. It was a reminder that, even as adults, we could still find joy in the simple things, like spending time with our cousins. And who knows, maybe next year we could even convince Rachel to sneak out of the house with us again."}

Harry laughed and scratched Max behind the ears. \"Don't worry, boy,\" he said. \"We'll get 'em next year.\" And with that, they headed home, already planning their strategy for the next snail herding competition."}

The app needs to be more specific about what it offers.\n* The call-to-action (\"Download Cohen today and start meeting new people!\") is too generic and doesn't provide any incentive to actually download the app.\n* The app's purpose is too broad. Is it a dating app, a social app, or a hook-up app?

For example, \"Cohen matches you with others who share your passions and hobbies, and allows you to connect with people in your area.\"\n* Tone down the language to make it more professional and respectful.

Authorities are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding this enigmatic event, which has left neighbors and acquaintances alike in a state of bewilderment.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Mr. Smith was last seen entering his residence on Elm Street at approximately 9:00 PM on Tuesday evening. His wife, Jane, reported that she retired to bed shortly thereafter, unaware of any unusual occurrences. It was not until the following morning, when she failed to receive her usual morning greeting from her husband, that she became concerned and alerted authorities.\n\nUpon arrival, police discovered Mr. Smith's lifeless body in his bedroom, with no signs of forced entry or struggle.
