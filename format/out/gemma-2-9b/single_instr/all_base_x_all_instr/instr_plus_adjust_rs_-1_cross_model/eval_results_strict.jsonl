Use words in all capital letters at least 3 times to highlight key points.\n\nHow to get to 100% renewable energy in the US? Two researchers from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley studied the potential for solar and wind energy to power the US grid. They concluded that it is possible to get to 100% renewable energy by 2050 by building more solar and wind farms. The authors also pointed out that such a system would be less vulnerable to disruptions than the current grid, which is reliant on a few large power plants.

Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\n", "response": " WORLD WAR II OR THE SECOND WORLD WAR, OFTEN ABBREVIATED AS WWII OR WW2, WAS A GLOBAL CONFLICT THAT LASTED FROM 1939 TO 1945.
