Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\n", "response": " WORLD WAR II OR THE SECOND WORLD WAR, OFTEN ABBREVIATED AS WWII OR WW2, WAS A GLOBAL CONFLICT THAT LASTED FROM 1939 TO 1945.

It is the official language of the Netherlands and Belgium, and it is also spoken by a large number of people in Suriname. The Dutch language has a rich history and a unique set of characteristics that make it interesting to learn.\n\nOne of the most interesting facts about the Dutch language is that it is a very direct language. Dutch speakers are known for being very direct and to the point, and this is reflected in the language itself. For example, the Dutch language does not have a lot of polite forms, and it is common to use the informal form of the pronoun \"you\" even when speaking to someone you don't know well.\n\nAnother interesting fact about the Dutch language is that it has a lot of loanwords from other languages. This is because the Dutch language has been influenced by many different languages over the years, including English, French, and German. For example, the Dutch word for \"computer\" is \"computer\", which is a loanword from English.\n\nFinally, the Dutch language has a lot of interesting grammar rules. For example, the Dutch language has a lot of verb forms, and it is important to use the correct form in each sentence. Additionally, the Dutch language has a lot of different ways to say \"yes\" and \"no\", and it is important to know which one to use in each situation.\n\nOverall, the Dutch language is a very interesting language to learn. It has a rich history and a unique set of characteristics that make it stand out from other languages. If you are interested in learning more about the Dutch language, I recommend checking out some of the resources below.\n\nResources:\n\n- [Dutch Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language)\n- [Dutch Grammar](https://www.dutchgrammar.com/)\n- [Dutch Vocabulary](https://www.duolingo.com/course/nl/en/Learn-Dutch)\n\n"}
