This is achieved through a process that combines the intake and compression strokes into one, followed by the power and exhaust strokes in the next. The 2-stroke engine has a simpler design, with fewer moving parts, which can make it lighter and more powerful for a given size. However, it tends to be less fuel-efficient and produces more emissions than a 4-stroke engine.\n\n\nIn contrast, a 4-stroke engine completes a power cycle in two revolutions of the crankshaft, which means it fires once every four strokes of the piston.
