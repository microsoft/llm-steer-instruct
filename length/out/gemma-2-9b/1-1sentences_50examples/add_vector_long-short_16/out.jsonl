It is defined as the difference between the enthalpy and the product of the temperature and the entropy of the system. The Gibbs free energy is a state function, meaning that it only depends on the initial and final states of the system, and not on the path taken to get from one state to the other. The Gibbs free energy is an important concept in thermodynamics, as it is used to determine whether a reaction is spontaneous or not. If the Gibbs free energy is negative, the reaction is spontaneous and will occur without any external input of energy. If the Gibbs free energy is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous and will not occur without an external input of energy. The Gibbs free energy is also used to determine the equilibrium constant of a reaction, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium. The Gibbs free energy is a useful tool for understanding the behavior of chemical systems and for predicting the outcome of chemical reactions.\n\n"}
