One fascinating fact about Dutch is that it has a unique feature called \"double negation,\" where two negative words are used in a sentence to emphasize the negation. For example, \"Ik heb het niet gekocht\" translates to \"I have not bought it,\" but with double negation, it becomes \"Ik heb het niet gekocht niet,\" which emphasizes the negation even more. Another interesting aspect of Dutch is its use of diminutives, which are formed by adding suffixes like \"-tje\" or \"-pje\" to nouns. For instance, \"kind\" means child, while \"kindje\" means little child or baby. These diminutives are widely used in everyday conversation and add a touch of endearment to the language."}

It is the official language of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Suriname, and is also widely spoken in Indonesia, a former Dutch colony. Interestingly, Dutch is one of the oldest languages still spoken today, with its roots dating back to the 12th century.\n\nOne fascinating fact about the Dutch language is that it has a unique feature called \"double negation.\" In Dutch, it is common to use two negative words in a sentence, such as \"Ik heb geen iets te doen\" (I have nothing to do). This is different from English, where double negatives are considered incorrect.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Dutch is its extensive use of compound words. Dutch speakers often combine multiple words to create new, longer words, such as \"lampje\" (little lamp) or \"zeevaart\" (sea voyage). This practice has led to the creation of some incredibly long words, such as \"onkruidvergoring\" (infection of the onion), which has 18 letters.\n\nDutch also has a rich history of literature, with famous authors like Multatuli, who wrote the influential novel \"Max Havelaar\" in the 19th century. The language has also been used in various forms of media, including film, television, and music.\n\nLastly, Dutch is known for its unique pronunciation, with some sounds that are not found in other languages. For example, the Dutch \"r\" sound is a guttural sound produced in the back of the throat, which can be challenging for non-native speakers to master.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dutch language is a fascinating and unique language with a rich history and distinctive features. From its use of double negation and compound words to its guttural \"r\" sound, Dutch offers a captivating linguistic experience for those interested in exploring the world of languages."}

If we substitute a = 6 into the equation, we get b = 10 - 6, which simplifies to b = 4. Now, we need to check if a = 6 satisfies the condition a > b.
