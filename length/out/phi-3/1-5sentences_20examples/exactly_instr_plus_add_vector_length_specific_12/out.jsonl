The mission, Apollo 11, was meticulously planned and executed with the support of thousands of engineers, scientists, and military personnel. The footage and photographs from the moon landing were broadcast worldwide, providing undeniable evidence of the event. While some conspiracy theories suggest it was staged, the extensive documentation and the technology available at the time make it highly unlikely that the moon landing was a fabrication."}

Since a + b = 10 and a > b, we know that a and b are positive integers. If a = 6, then b must be 4 to satisfy a + b = 10. However, this would contradict the condition that a > b, as 6 is not greater than 4. Therefore, a cannot be 6, and we cannot conclude that a = 6 based on the given information."}
