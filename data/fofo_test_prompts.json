This strategy should maximize returns whilst controlling risk according to the following specific parameters and configurations:\n\n1. **Portfolio Composition**:\n    - Asset classes: Equities, Commodities, FX pairs, and Fixed Income.\n    - For each asset class, select a representative set of at least 5 instruments. Specify the ticker symbol, the exchange, and a brief rationale for its inclusion in the portfolio.\n    - The initial capital allocated to the portfolio is $10 million.\n\n2. **Risk Management Parameters (SPAN)**:\n    - The SPAN system requires the calculation of the following:\n      - **Scan Risk**: Evaluate a range of underlying price changes and volatilities for each product. Provide a comprehensive scenario analysis across +/-15% of current underlying prices in 0.5% increments.\n      - **Tiered Scanning Ranges**: Adapt the scenario analysis for inter-month and inter-commodity spreading, where applicable.\n      - **Intra-commodity Convolutions**: Apply appropriate spread charge discounts using recognized offsets.\n      - **Short Option Minimum (SOM)**: Determine the minimum margin requirements for short options across each asset class.\n      - **Risk Arrays**: Provide 16-scenario risk arrays for options reflecting deltas, gammas, and decay of those options across the portfolio.\n    - Incorporate SPAN margin requirements in the risk management constraints of the trading strategy. The total margin should not exceed 30% of the portfolio\u2019s net liquidating value.\n\n3. **Strategy Implementation**:\n    - Order Execution: Define a set of rules for order execution which includes timing, sizing (in line with SPAN margin requirements), and price limits. Take into account the liquidity profile of each instrument.\n    - Signal Generation: Create a series of technical and fundamental indicators that will trigger buy or sell signals across different timeframes. Explain the logic behind each indicator.\n    - Backtesting: Apply your strategy to historical data spanning at least the past 3 years to evaluate performance. Include metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n4. **SPAN Format-Compliant Reporting**:\n    - Provide a daily report outlining the portfolio's compliance with SPAN risk requirements. This report should show:\n      - The SPAN parameters and the scenario analysis for each asset.\n      - How each trade fits into the overall SPAN-based risk management framework.\n      - Any breaches of SPAN requirements and the corresponding adjustments made.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Data**:\n    - You can assume historical close prices, volatility profiles, and market data as needed. You may also specify any assumptions regarding transaction costs, slippage, and interest rates.\n    - Where exact data is unavailable, improvise with dummy figures, but ensure consistency and realism in their application. The data should be internally consistent and resemble plausible market scenarios.\n\nDocument and summarize the algorithm trading strategy with attention to detail and the interpretation of the SPAN margin system. Your documentation should stand as a model to be reviewed by a risk management compliance team prior to deployment of the strategy."

Include a placeholder `<image>` element with an `xlink:href` attribute pointing to a dummy image URL. The banner should also have a caption using the `<text>` element, stating \"Welcome to Our Website\".\n\n3. **Content Section:** Below the banner, create three columns to represent content sections. Use `<rect>` elements for the columns and fill them with a light gray color. Each column should contain a `<text>` element for the title (you may fabricate the titles), and multiple `<line>` elements to simulate text content.\n\n4. **Sidebar:** Add a sidebar to the right of the content section using a `<rect>` element. Inside the sidebar, create a list of items with `<circle>` elements as bullet points and accompanying `<text>` elements for item descriptions (fabricate three list items).\n\n5. **Footer:** At the bottom, design a footer that spans the entire width of the SVG. The footer should contain social media icons, expressed as `<path>` elements defined by specific `d` attribute paths for a Facebook \"f\", a Twitter bird, and an Instagram camera. Provide a placeholder link for each using the `xlink:href` attribute.\n\n6. **Styling:** Use a consistent color scheme throughout the SVG with at most four colors, and specify them using CSS `<style>` element within your SVG. Assign class attributes to the SVG elements and style them properly (e.g., .header, .menu-item, .content-section, etc.).\n\n7. **Interactivity:** Include `<title>` elements for accessibility and tooltips on the navigation menu and social media icons. These should display text when hovered over with a mouse.\n\n8. **Responsiveness:** Ensure the SVG has a `viewBox` attribute that allows the entire layout to scale proportionally. Provide two `<g>` elements, each containing elements that will either show or hide when the aspect ratio changes, simulating a desktop and a mobile layout.\n\nEnsure that all elements are properly structured and grouped (`<g>` element) for easy editing and maintainability. Your SVG should be well-commented, describing each section of the layout and how elements interact with each other, given the scalability and responsiveness requirements.\n\nValidate your SVG against the official W3C validator to ensure it adheres to SVG standards and does not contain any errors.

The task will involve multiple components to ensure a functional and basic system. The output should strictly adhere to the 'Python Files (.py)' format, where proper Python coding conventions must be followed, such as PEP 8 style guide compliance, clear variable naming, and in-line comments for code clarity. The script is required to perform the following operations:\n\n1. A Class Definition:\n   - Define a Python class called `LightDB` which will handle the interaction with the database.\n   - The class should have an initializer that accepts a `db_file_path` parameter for specifying the file path to store the database.\n   - Include error handling to ensure that if the file cannot be opened or created, a meaningful error message is displayed.\n\n2. Data Storage Model:\n   - The database will store its data in a JSON format, allowing nested structures.\n   - Implement methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) within the `LightDB` class.\n     - `create(record)`: Inserts a new record (Python dictionary) into the database.\n     - `read(query)`: Retrieves records that match the given query (a Python dictionary representing the search criteria).\n     - `update(query, update_data)`: Updates records based on the query with the new data provided.\n     - `delete(query)`: Deletes records that match the given query.\n\n3. Data Persistence:\n   - Each change to the data must be recorded immediately to the file specified by `db_file_path`.\n   - Implement a private method to handle the read and write operations to the file.\n\n4. Query Functionality:\n   - Enable the system to support simple queries such as finding records with exact matches.\n   - Support querying with multiple criteria, for example, finding records where `name == \"John Doe\"` and `age >= 30`.\n\n5. Exception Handling:\n   - Ensure all methods within the `LightDB` class have appropriate exception handling to deal with common errors such as incorrect data types, missing files, and invalid queries.\n\n6. Example Records and Queries:\n   - Demonstrate the functionality of the script with example usage.\n   - Create at least 3 example records using the `create()` method.\n   - Perform a read operation with a query to find a record by a specific field.\n   - Update a record and show the before and after state.\n   - Delete one record and show the data persistence by reading all remaining records.\n\n7. High-Level Script Interaction:\n   - In the main body of the script, interpret a basic CLI (command line interface) argument operation (where the user can type `create`, `read`, `update` or `delete`) to interact with the `LightDB` instance.\n   - Ensure your script can be executed directly with command-line arguments to perform the CRUD operations. For instance, a user may input `python lightdb.py read '{\"name\": \"John Doe\"}'` to execute a read operation.\n\nRemember, your goal is to demonstrate your ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient Python code. If you need to make up dummy data for sample records or queries, feel free to include realistic examples. However, ensure there is clear differentiation between code and data in your responses to accurately represent a typical Python file structure."

Ensure all SQL operations are properly managed with correct use of try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, and that prepared statements are used for executing SQL queries.\n9. Use transaction management with appropriate commit and rollback mechanisms to ensure data integrity.\n10. At the bottom of the file, define the `InsufficientFundsException` class extending `Exception`, complete with a constructor that accepts a custom message.\n\nYou may make up any additional dummy data necessary for the database connection or account details, such as database URLs, table names, and column names, ensuring they follow typical SQL naming conventions. Make sure the source code is neatly formatted, following standard Java coding conventions, and includes meaningful comments explaining critical sections of the code."

The vending machine will offer a selection of five different products, each with a unique item code, name, and price.\n2. The user of the program should be able to select a product by entering its item code.\n3. The program should then prompt the user to input the amount of money they are inserting into the vending machine. Acceptable denominations are $1, $5, $10, and $25 cents.\n4. If the user has inserted enough money for the product, the vending machine should calculate the change, if any, and display the details to the user. If the user has not inserted enough money, the machine should display a message indicating so and end the transaction.\n5. The vending machine should keep track of the inventory for each product. It starts with 10 units of each product and should decrement appropriately with each successful transaction.\n6. The program should stay operational, allowing multiple product selections and transactions until the user chooses to exit.\n\nSpecific configurations:\n\n- Use an object-oriented approach and define a class for the vending machine (`VendingMachine`) with appropriate data members and member functions.\n- Within the `VendingMachine` class, define a nested structure or class for a product (`Product`) which holds details such as item code, name, price, and inventory count.\n- Implement error checking for user inputs (e.g., invalid codes, invalid denomination inserts, etc.).\n- Provide an initial text-based user interface within the main function that offers the user the choices of products and accepts user inputs.\n- The program should be neatly divided into functional blocks with comments explaining each section of the code.\n- Format the output text to be user-friendly and clear in its instructions and responses to user inputs.\n\nThe `.cpp` file should use appropriate naming conventions for variables, classes, and functions. Assume the prices of the products range from 50 cents to $2.50, and you can create dummy names and item codes for the products. Also, assume standard C++ libraries are available for use.\n\nFor example, you should define the C++ file with appropriate include statements, define the classes, the main function with the program loop, and ensure proper data encapsulation and abstraction principles are followed within the object-oriented design.\n\nPlease note that no actual payment or change dispensing implementation is required; only an algorithmic simulation is needed.

(additional rows following the same pattern for each concentration and pH level)\n```\n\nNote that the data should follow a logical scientific pattern; for example, typically enzyme activity tends to change with pH and may either increase or decrease with the concentration of an inhibitor, while Km and kcat may also vary accordingly, often inversely relative to one another in the presence of inhibitors. The data generated should reflect such typical patterns observed in enzyme kinetics.\n\nEnsure the final CSV output adheres to the format standards, with no trailing spaces, proper commas as delimiters, and no extraneous characters or lines.

Adaptive Learning Paths:\n   - Based on the performance in checkpoints, offer two branching paths: remediation or enrichment. Describe at least two additional activities for each path which cater to the needs of students who require further help and those who are ready for advanced concepts.\n\n6. End-of-Unit Assessment:\n   - Devise a comprehensive assessment of 20 questions to evaluate understanding across all areas of the unit. This assessment should include multiple-choice, short answer, and problem-solving questions.\n   - The assessment must adapt in real-time, offering additional scaffolding questions if a student is struggling or more advanced questions if the student is excelling.\n\n7. Gamification Elements:\n   - Integrate elements of gamification such as badges, leaderboards, or points to motivate students. Detail at least three achievements that can be unlocked with progression through the unit.\n\n8. Accommodations for Diverse Learners:\n   - Address at least two accommodations to support diverse learning needs, such as closed captions for videos, text-to-speech for content, or alternative input methods for interactive components.\n\n9. Teacher Dashboard:\n   - Summarize the features of a teacher dashboard that allows monitoring of student progress, with analytics on the performance of the class in various sections of the unit.\n   - The dashboard should include alerts for students who may be struggling, letting teachers know when to intervene with additional support.\n\n10. Feedback and Revision Suggestions:\n    - Provide a section at the end of the unit where students can submit feedback. Suggest three focused questions that can guide student feedback to improve the content and structure of the unit.\n\nYou are allowed to make up any necessary data and improvise on ungiven details. Ensure all content is pedagogically sound, engaging, and appropriate for the 11th-grade level. The final unit should be a blend of strong academic rigor and interactive, adaptive learning practices."

Use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to transcribe the dialogue.\n2. The dialogue should consist of at least 20 exchanges (10 per character), with each exchange including one or more sentences.\n3. Highlight the sentence stress by underlining the stressed syllables in each word that carries the main sentence stress.\n4. Use a superscripted numeral to indicate the tone at the end of each sentence (1 for falling tone, 2 for rising tone, 3 for flat tone, and 4 for the fall-rise tone).\n5. Provide phonetic markings to represent intonation patterns within each sentence, using the following symbols:\n   - a rising arrow (\u2197) for rising intonation\n   - a falling arrow (\u2198) for falling intonation\n   - a straight horizontal line (\u2015) for flat intonation\n   - A combination of arrows for fall-rise intonation patterns. (e.g., \u2198\u2197)\n6. Include stage directions, in brackets, for contextual actions that may alter pronunciation, such as sighing, laughing, or hesitation.\n7. For each expression or phrase that is idiomatic, provide a brief explanation in parentheses following the IPA transcription of how the idiom affects pronunciation and intonation.\n8. Incorporate at least five instances of connected speech features such as linkage (e.g., /j/, /w/, /\u026an/), elision, assimilation, or intrusion, and clearly indicate these within the script.\n9. Ensure the dialogue is contextually relevant to a situation encountered in everyday life, which will help students practice pronunciation in practical settings.\n\nAssume the characters are meeting for coffee and discussing their plans for the weekend, which will allow for varied intonational patterns and afford practical usage of idiomatic language. You may improvise details of their conversation and background as necessary, but ensure the speech is representative of native English speaker interaction and the level of language is suitable for intermediate learners.\n\nHere is an example of how the phonetic script might begin:\n\nCharacter A: [Excitedly] \"I c\u1d27n't \u21e2w\u03b5\u026at\u2197 f\u0254r \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8w\u026ak\u02ccend!\" (\u21914)\nCharacter B: [Responding with curiosity] \"\u2198Wha\u2197t's \u2191on \u02c8your \u2198agenda?\" (\u21912)\nNote: Remember to provide the full dialogue with the complete phonetic script format and adhere to the configurations outlined above."

The tagline should elicit themes of love and secrecy. It's a modern-day story about an up-and-coming journalist who unravels a mystery involving a reclusive, aging film star. The location is a small coastal town, and the time setting is early autumn. Ensure that the protagonist is well-developed and the antagonist presents a meaningful conflict. Improve one key scene that demonstrates a major turning point and discuss the themes of truth, ambition, and the cost of fame."

Your evaluation should focus on potential risks associated with the agreement and propose necessary amendments to safeguard Party A's interests. You must present your findings and suggestions using the 'Risk Assessment Format', which comprises the following specific criteria:\n\n1. **Risk Identification**: Identify and list each potential legal, financial, operational, and reputational risk contained within the contract clauses. Use a structured approach to categorize the risks (e.g., Clause Number, Risk Category, and Risk Description).\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**: Provide a detailed analysis of each identified risk. For each risk, assess the likelihood of occurrence (on a scale from 'Low' to 'High') and the potential impact (on a scale from 'Low' to 'High') on Party A should the risk materialize. Include a rationale for each likelihood and impact assessment.\n\n3. **Risk Prioritization**: Rank the identified risks in order of significance based on a matrix of likelihood and impact. High likelihood combined with high impact should be prioritized, followed by either high likelihood or impact, and then both low likelihood and impact.\n\n4. **Mitigation Strategies**: For the highest-priority risks, propose specific contractual amendments or clauses that Party A should consider negotiating to mitigate these risks. Your proposals should include suggested wording and justifications.\n\n5. **Residual Risk Evaluation**: After proposing mitigations, evaluate any residual risks that remain. Determine if these residual risks are within an acceptable threshold for Party A or if further action is required.\n\n6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Summarize your findings, highlighting major risks and their mitigations, and suggest overall recommendations for Party A regarding the acceptability of the contract and any additional steps they should take.\n\nConsider the following dummy data for your analysis: \n\n- Clause 5.1 contains an indemnity provision that is broadly worded, potentially exposing Party A to substantial unanticipated liabilities.\n- Clause 7.3(a) allows Party B to subcontract its obligations without prior written consent from Party A.\n- Clause 11.4 has an automatic renewal term that may lock Party A into a long-term commitment without adequate performance review mechanisms.\n- Clause 9.2 provides Party B with rights to ownership of any new IP developed, which may conflict with Party A's interests in retaining certain rights.\n- Clause 14.1 vaguely defines the conditions under which the contract can be terminated for cause, potentially leading to disputes over interpretation.\n\nAs an AI agent, use these dummy data points to compose your analysis in the Risk Assessment Format, and where necessary, you are permitted to create additional details or assumptions to enhance your assessment. Be mindful that all generated content should plausible within the framework of standard business contracts and should not present an unrealistic scenario. Your analysis must be coherent, comprehensive, and precise, with particular attention paid to legal consistencies and the protective measures for Party A."

The final artwork should be 12 feet wide and 8 feet high, with a maximum relief depth of 4 inches, effectively creating a bas-relief. The landscape layer should include mountains, rivers, and trees that transition smoothly into a skyline of skyscrapers, flying cars, and holographic billboards. The entire scene should include intricate details, such as leaves on the trees, texture on the mountains, reflections on the water, individual windows on the buildings, and dynamic lighting effects on the billboards.\n\nEnsure the G-code is configured for a 4-axis CNC machine capable of intricate carving operations. The machine uses a 0.25-inch flat end mill for rough passes and a 0.05-inch ball nose end mill for finishing details. Set the G-code for the following specifics:\n\n1. The origin (0,0,0) is set at the top left corner of the foam block, with the positive Z-axis pointing upwards, away from the material.\n2. Use a roughing pass to remove the bulk of the material at a feed rate of 100 inches per minute and a plunge rate of 30 inches per minute, ensuring the safety height is set at 0.5 inches above the material.\n3. Implement a step-down strategy with a maximum cut depth per pass of 0.25 inches for the roughing phase.\n4. Transition to the finishing pass with the ball nose end mill, adjusting the feed rate to 60 inches per minute and a reduced plunge rate of 15 inches per minute.\n5. Employ raster milling strategies for the rough pass and contour milling strategies for the finishing pass to capture all the detailed features of the mural.\n6. Include tabs that are 0.5 inches wide and 0.25 inches thick at regular intervals to prevent the carved sections from shifting or falling out.\n7. The G-code should allow for tool changes, pausing for repositioning, and include coolant activation commands where necessary to manage any heat buildup since foam can melt or warp.\n8. To enable efficient processing and reduce the risk of tool breakage, implement ramping during the entries and exits of cuts.\n9. Include comments in the G-code to document the start and end of each major section (e.g., mountains transition, cityscape start, etc.) and for each tool change.\n\nYou may improvise on specific landscape and cityscape design elements and the exact positioning of each within the mural, as well as on the placement of relief elements and finer details, as long as the overall theme and size constraints are respected. Use a safe margin of error of at least 0.1 inches to account for any potential discrepancies in the material or milling process. Generate the G-code in sections corresponding to logical divisions in the artwork, with each section clearly labeled and commented for ease of understanding and future modifications."

The shader should work on a flat plane representing the water surface. Assume the plane's normal is in the positive Y-direction in world space.\n\n2. Implement a realistic-looking water effect by using a combination of techniques:\n   - Normal mapping with a tiling water normal texture. You have to define the texture coordinates ranging from (0.0, 0.0) to (1.0, 1.0) across the plane.\n   - Implementing wave movement by using a sine function to produce vertex displacement along the Y-axis. Use at least two sine waves with different amplitudes and frequencies for a more complex wave pattern.\n   - The shader should include a method for simulating the sun's reflection off the water surface known as specular highlight. You must set the sun's position in world space and calculate the reflection based on the Phong reflection model.\n\n3. Allow for dynamic light interaction by including a point light source. Define the light's position, color, and intensity. Calculate the light's effect on the water using the Blinn-Phong model for specular highlights in addition to a diffuse component.\n\n4. Include environmental factors such as wind speed and direction, which should affect the wave movement and intensity. The shader should take these factors as uniform inputs.\n\n5. Integrate a fresnel effect based on the viewer's angle to simulate how the water's reflectivity changes based on the view angle, enhancing the realism of the water surface.\n\n6. Implement a distortion effect near the edges of the water surface to simulate the water's refractive properties. Use a scaled noise texture to achieve the distortion and pass the scale factor as a uniform variable.\n\n7. Use a hard-coded value for the water's base color, but it should be adjustable via a uniform variable. The water color should blend with the distorted texture color based on the angle of incidence.\n\n8. Assume a camera is positioned in world space with a given position and direction. Pass the camera's properties to the shader as uniform variables to calculate the view-dependent effects correctly.\n\n9. Ensure that the shader performs well by optimizing mathematical operations where feasible and avoiding unnecessary calculations per fragment.\n\n10. Provide appropriate comments within the GLSL code to explain the purpose of different sections and major calculations.\n\n11. Write the shader in GLSL version 330 and use strictly the syntax and functionalities available in this version.\n\nPlease make up any necessary texture filenames, wave parameters, light properties, environmental factors, and dummy camera data not explicitly provided in the prompt.

Use the Print String node to output these initial greetings.\n- Base the next part of the dialogue on the player's morality. \"Good\" morality should lead to a dialogue node with a compliment, \"neutral\" to a simple acknowledgment, and \"bad\" to a concerned or fearful reaction. Again, use Print String nodes for these outputs.\n- Continue the conversation by checking the current quest stage:\n  - **notStarted**: The NPC should offer the quest and provide background information.\n  - **inProgress**: Reflect on the current progress with hints or encouragement.\n  - **completed**: Congratulate the player and offer a reward.\n- The specific lines of dialogue for each of these scenarios should be generated, ensuring they fit the context of a fantasy adventure game. Each dialogue alternative should be outputted through a Print String node.\n- Introduce a decision-making point where the dialogue branches based on a player's choice: \"Accept Quest\", \"Reject Quest\", or \"Ask for More Information\". Depending on the choice, use a Print String node to confirm the player's decision and push the conversation in the corresponding direction.\n- Structure the visual scripting nodes in a way that the dialogue feels natural, with each new line triggered after a delay that simulates the time it would take for the character speaking to finish their sentence.\n- For unprovided data such as specific dialogue lines or variable names, improvise based on the typical naming conventions in Unreal Engine Blueprint, ensuring that they are descriptive and easily understood (e.g., Player_Morality, Quest_Stage, Relationship_Level). Use dummy data where needed for demonstration.\n- Provide comments in the Blueprint script using the Comment node that explains each part of the dialogue structure, and specifies what each section does and why it's necessary for dynamic dialogue flow.\n\nThe final output should be the blueprint visual script that can be immediately tested in the Unreal Engine, with clear labels, comments, and adhering strictly to the 'Print String Node' output for displaying dialogue text."
