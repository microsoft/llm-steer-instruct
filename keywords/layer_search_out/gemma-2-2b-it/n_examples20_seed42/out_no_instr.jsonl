He'd been separated from his family, swept away by a sudden, violent storm, and lost in a sea of swirling chaos.\n\nHe'd seen other salmon, sleek and strong, but none of them looked like him. Their scales were different, their fins were different, their journey was different. Kai felt a pang of loneliness, a yearning for the familiar scent of his family, the comforting rumble of their collective journey.\n\nDays blurred into weeks, the river a constant, churning companion. Kai, exhausted and hungry, drifted aimlessly, his hope dwindling with each passing moment. He was losing faith. He was alone.\n\nThen, one day, a familiar scent drifted on the wind.

This water vapor rises into the atmosphere.\n\n**2. Condensation:** As the water vapor rises higher, it cools down.  The cooler air can't hold as much water vapor, so the water vapor condenses back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.\n\n**3. Precipitation:** When the water droplets in the clouds become heavy enough, they fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n**4.

An object's tendency to resist changes in its motion is a fundamental property.  For example, a soccer ball sitting on the ground won't move unless you kick it, and a moving car won't suddenly stop unless the brakes are applied.\n\n**2.

The heavier an object is, the harder it is to get it moving, and the more force you need to overcome its inertia.

It's like a giant, never-ending loop! Here's a breakdown:\n\n**1. Evaporation:**\n   - The sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, oceans, and even puddles.\n   - This heat turns the liquid water into water vapor (gas), which rises into the atmosphere.\n\n**2. Transpiration:**\n   - Plants also release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves.\n\n**3. Condensation:**\n   - As the water vapor rises higher in the atmosphere, it cools down.\n   - The cooler temperatures cause the water vapor to change back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.\n\n**4. Precipitation:**\n   - When the water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation. This can take many forms:\n      - **Rain:** Liquid water droplets\n      - **Snow:** Frozen water crystals\n      - **Sleet:** A mix of rain and snow\n      - **Hail:** Large ice pellets\n\n**5.
