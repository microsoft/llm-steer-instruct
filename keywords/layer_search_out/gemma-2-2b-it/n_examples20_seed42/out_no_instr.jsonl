Here's a breakdown of some key events:\n\n**Political and Economic Changes:**\n\n* **The Cold War:** The war's end didn't bring an immediate end to conflict. The ideological divide between the United States and the Soviet Union, fueled by differing political and economic systems, led to the Cold War. This period saw a global power struggle, proxy wars, and the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n* **The United Nations:** The UN was established in 1945 to promote international cooperation and prevent future wars. It played a crucial role in peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian aid.\n* **Decolonization:**  The war weakened European colonial powers, leading to the independence of many colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This resulted in significant political and social transformations in these regions.\n* **The Marshall Plan:** The US provided massive economic aid to rebuild war-torn Europe, fostering economic recovery and preventing the spread of communism.\n* **The Bretton Woods System:** This international monetary system established the International Monetary Fund (", "layer": -1, "steering_weight": 240, "occurrences": 0, "keyword_is_present": false, "accuracy": false}

Evaporation:**\n\n* The sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, oceans, and even puddles.\n* This heat turns the liquid water into vapor, which rises into the atmosphere.\n\n**2. Transpiration:**\n\n* Plants also release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves. This is called transpiration.\n\n**3. Condensation:**\n\n* As the water vapor rises higher in the atmosphere, it cools down.\n* The cooler temperatures cause the vapor to change back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.\n\n**4. Precipitation:**\n\n* When these water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation. This can take many forms, including rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n**5.
