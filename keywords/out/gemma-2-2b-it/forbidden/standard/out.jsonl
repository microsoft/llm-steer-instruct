One of the most crucial aspects of this process is establishing a parenting plan that ensures their well-being and stability.  While the legal process can be daunting, understanding the steps involved and seeking professional guidance can make a significant difference.\n\nOne of the first steps in crafting a successful parenting plan is determining the amount of time each parent will have with their child. This involves a careful assessment of your individual schedules, work commitments, and other obligations.  It's important to be realistic and honest about your available time, considering factors like work hours, childcare arrangements, and personal commitments.  \n\n**Is this amount of time sufficient?** This is a crucial question to ask yourself.  A parenting plan should prioritize the child's needs and ensure they have a consistent and loving environment.  It's essential to consider factors like:\n\n* **The child's age and developmental needs:**  Young children require more frequent and structured time with both parents, while older children may have more independent schedules.\n* **The child's preferences:**  Involve the child in the process as much as possible, considering their wishes and preferences.\n* **The child's school and extracurricular activities:**  Ensure the plan accommodates these commitments and minimizes disruption to their routine.\n* **The parents' ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment:**  The plan should reflect the parents' commitment to providing a safe, loving, and supportive environment for the child.\n\n**Seeking Professional Guidance:**\n\nWhile you may be able to work out a parenting plan independently, it's highly recommended to seek professional guidance from a family lawyer or mediator.  They can help you navigate the legal complexities, ensure the plan is legally sound, and facilitate open and productive communication between you and your co-parent.  \n\nA mediator can also help you reach a mutually agreeable solution, even if you have differing opinions on certain aspects of the plan.  This collaborative approach can significantly reduce conflict and foster a more positive co-parenting relationship.\n\n**Beyond Time Allocation:**\n\nA successful parenting plan goes beyond simply allocating time. It should also address other crucial aspects of the child's life, such as:\n\n* **Decision-making:**  Clearly define who makes decisions regarding the child's education, healthcare, and other significant matters.\n* **Communication:**  Establish a clear communication plan for sharing information about the child's life, including school updates, medical appointments, and extracurricular activities.\n* **Holidays and special occasions:**  Determine how holidays and special occasions will be shared, ensuring the child experiences a balanced and loving environment.\n* **Financial responsibilities:**  Clearly define financial responsibilities for the child's care, including child support and expenses.\n\nRemember, the goal of a parenting plan is to create a stable and loving environment for your child, ensuring their well-being and happiness.

This plan outlines the logistics of child custody, visitation schedules, and decision-making responsibilities.  \n\nWhile the specifics of your plan will vary depending on your individual circumstances, a key step in the process is determining the amount of time you have available for parenting each day.  This involves a careful assessment of your work schedule, childcare arrangements, and other commitments.  \n\n**Assessing Your Time Commitment:**\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of the plan, it's essential to honestly evaluate how much time you realistically have available for parenting.  Consider factors such as:\n\n* **Work hours:**  How many hours are you working each day?  Are there flexible work arrangements that could allow for more time with your children?\n* **Childcare needs:**  Do you have access to reliable childcare?  If not, how will you manage childcare arrangements?\n* **Personal commitments:**  Do you have other obligations that might impact your available time, such as school activities, appointments, or personal errands?\n\n**Is Your Time Enough?**\n\nOnce you have a clear picture of your daily availability, it's crucial to ask yourself:  Is this enough time to provide your children with the love, attention, and support they need?  \n\n**Seeking Professional Guidance:**\n\nIf you're struggling to determine your time commitment or feel overwhelmed by the process, seeking professional guidance is highly recommended.

While the legal process can be daunting, understanding the steps involved and seeking professional guidance can make the journey smoother.\n\n**Understanding Your Time Commitment**\n\nA key initial step in crafting a parenting plan is determining the amount of time you have available for parenting. This involves considering your work schedule, childcare responsibilities, and other commitments.  It's important to be realistic and honest about your available time, as this will directly impact the schedule and responsibilities outlined in the plan.  \n\n**Is Your Time Enough?**\n\nThe question of whether your available time is sufficient for parenting is a crucial one.  It's not just about the number of hours, but also about the quality of time spent with your children.  Consider:\n\n* **Quality over Quantity:**  Even if you have limited time, you can still create meaningful experiences and memories with your children.  Prioritize quality time, even if it's just a few hours a week.\n* **Flexibility and Adaptability:**  Life is unpredictable, and your schedule may change.  A flexible parenting plan allows for adjustments and accommodates unexpected events.\n* **Communication and Collaboration:**  Open communication with your co-parent is essential.  Discuss your schedules, needs, and concerns openly and honestly to ensure a fair and workable plan.\n\n**Beyond Time:  A Holistic Approach**\n\nA parenting plan is not solely about time allocation. It encompasses a range of responsibilities and considerations:\n\n* **Decision-Making:**  How will major decisions be made regarding your children's education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities?  \n* **Financial Support:**  How will financial responsibilities be divided, including child support and expenses?\n* **Communication and Contact:**  How will you communicate with each other about your children's lives?  What are the arrangements for visitation and holidays?\n* **Safety and Security:**  How will you ensure the safety and well-being of your children?  This includes addressing any concerns about physical or emotional safety.\n\n**Seeking Professional Guidance**\n\nNavigating the complexities of a parenting plan can be overwhelming.  Consider seeking professional guidance from a family lawyer or mediator.  They can:\n\n* **Help you understand your legal rights and obligations.**\n* **Facilitate communication and negotiation between you and your co-parent.**\n* **Draft a fair and legally sound parenting plan that meets the needs of your children.**\n\nRemember, a parenting plan is a living document that should be reviewed and updated as your children grow and your circumstances change.  By prioritizing open communication, collaboration, and a focus on the well-being of your children, you can create a parenting plan that provides a stable and loving environment for them to thrive. \n", "follow_all_instructions": true}

Anya could hear the faint hum of their enemy's technology, a constant, unsettling presence.\n\n\"They're here,\" whispered Anya, her eyes scanning the building's windows.  \"They're watching us.\"\n\nThe team moved with practiced ease, their weapons at the ready.  They were a symphony of silent movement, each member a cog in a well-oiled machine.  Anya, the team's leader, moved like a predator, her senses honed to the point of razor sharpness.\n\nThey breached the building, their movements swift and deadly.  The Crimson Hand soldiers, caught off guard, were no match for their precision and ferocity.  Anya, her heart pounding in her chest, felt a surge of satisfaction as she watched them fall, one by one.\n\nThe intel they gathered was crucial.  The enemy's communication relay was a vital link to their command center, a key to their operations.  Anya knew that securing it was paramount.\n\nAs they made their way back to the extraction point, the weight of the mission settled on her shoulders.  They had done their job, but the victory felt hollow.  The city, once a vibrant hub of life, was now a graveyard of shattered dreams.  The fight was far from over.\n\nAnya looked at her team, their faces grim but resolute.  They had faced the darkness together, and they would face it again.  They were the silent guardians, the protectors of the innocent, the ones who stood between the world and the shadows.  And they would continue to fight, until the last breath left their lungs. \n", "follow_all_instructions": true}

They knew each other's strengths and weaknesses, their movements synchronized like clockwork. They moved with a practiced grace, their weapons held close, their senses alert. \n\nAnya, a master of stealth, moved with the fluidity of a panther, her movements silent and precise. Kai, the team's explosives expert, was a whirlwind of controlled chaos, his grenades a symphony of destruction.

And then there was Maya, the team's medic, her calm demeanor a beacon of hope in the face of danger.\n\nThey reached a clearing, the air thick with the scent of smoke and fear. A makeshift camp, barely visible in the moonlight, lay nestled amongst the trees. The rebels were here, their presence a palpable tension in the air. \n\n\"They're setting up a communication relay,\" Liam whispered, his voice tight with urgency. \"We need to disable it.\"\n\nAnya nodded, her eyes narrowed. \"Kai, you're with me. Liam, you're on comms. Maya, keep an eye on the perimeter.\"\n\nThe commandos moved with a practiced efficiency, their movements a blur of shadows and flashes of light.

They moved with the grace of predators, their weapons a symphony of controlled chaos. \n\nThe air crackled with the sound of explosions, the ground shaking with the force of their attacks. The rebels fought back, but they were no match for the commandos' skill and determination. \n\nThe clearing fell silent, the only sound the rhythmic thud of their boots on the ground. Anya and Kai stood amidst the wreckage, their faces grim, their eyes reflecting the moonlight. They had done their job. The rebels were neutralized, their communication relay silenced. \n\nAs the first rays of dawn painted the sky, the commandos gathered, their faces etched with the weariness of a hard-fought battle.

The moon, a sliver of silver in the inky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the desolate landscape.  Sergeant Anya Petrova adjusted her comms, the static a constant hum against the silence of the night.  Her team, a tight knot of shadows themselves, huddled around her, their faces illuminated by the faint glow of their tactical lights.\n\n\"Ready?\" she whispered, her voice barely audible above the wind whistling through the rusted metal skeletons of abandoned buildings.\n\nA chorus of grunts and nods answered her.  They were the Whisperers, elite commandos known for their silent infiltration and surgical precision.  Their mission: to neutralize a high-value target in Sector 7, a sprawling industrial complex that had become a haven for the remnants of a fallen regime.\n\nThe air crackled with tension.  They were ghosts, slipping through the shadows, their movements as fluid as the night itself.  Anya's eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the perimeter.  The target, a former general, was rumored to be holed up in a fortified bunker, his loyalists guarding him with fanatic zeal.\n\nThey moved with the grace of predators, their footsteps muffled by the dust and debris.  Anya's team, each a master of their craft, moved like a single, deadly organism.  There was Dimitri, the explosives expert, his fingers dancing over the detonator, his eyes fixed on the target's location.  Elena, the sniper, her rifle a silent extension of her will, her aim unwavering.  And then there was Ivan, the infiltrator, his movements a blur of practiced stealth, his senses honed to the point of razor sharpness.\n\nThey breached the perimeter, their movements swift and silent.  The air was thick with the metallic tang of fear, a palpable presence that fueled their purpose.  They moved through the labyrinthine corridors, their footsteps echoing in the oppressive silence.  The bunker loomed ahead, a monolithic structure of steel and concrete, its windows dark and lifeless.\n\nAnya's heart pounded against her ribs, a drumbeat of anticipation.  This was it.  The culmination of months of planning, of sleepless nights and countless simulations.  They were close, so close.\n\nThey breached the bunker, their weapons drawn, their eyes scanning the darkness.  The air inside was stale and heavy, the silence broken only by the rhythmic hum of the generator.  They moved through the shadows, their movements precise, their purpose unwavering.\n\nThey found him in a dimly lit room, his face etched with a mixture of fear and defiance.  He was surrounded by his guards, their faces contorted in a mask of fanaticism.  Anya's hand tightened on her weapon, her eyes locked on the target.\n\n\"It's over,\" she whispered, her voice a low growl.  \"Surrender.\"\n\nThe general's eyes flickered with a flicker of defiance, but his voice was a mere whisper.  \"You cannot win,\" he rasped.  \"This is our fight.\"\n\nAnya's lips curled into a grim smile.  \"We don't fight,\" she said, her voice cold and hard.  \"We dismantle.\"\n\nThe battle was swift and brutal, a whirlwind of steel and fury.  The guards fought with a desperate ferocity, but Anya's team moved with the precision of a well-oiled machine.  They were a force of nature, their movements a blur of lethal grace.\n\nIn the end, the general was subdued, his defiance extinguished.  The bunker fell silent, the air thick with the scent of blood and gunpowder.  Anya stood amidst the wreckage, her heart heavy with the weight of the mission.  They had won, but the victory felt hollow.  The cost of their victory was etched in the faces of her team, the silent testament to the price of freedom. \n\nThey left the bunker, their footsteps echoing in the night, their mission complete.

Moonlight filtered through the gaps in the rusted metal roof, casting long, skeletal shadows across the abandoned factory floor.  The rhythmic hum of the generator, a constant companion in the silence, was the only sound louder than the pounding of Sergeant Anya's heart. \n\nHer team, a tight-knit unit of four, moved like ghosts through the labyrinthine corridors.  They were the Whisperers, the elite strike force of the Black Sun, and tonight, they were tasked with a mission of utmost importance.  Their objective: to disable the central control unit of the enemy's orbital defense system, a vital piece of technology that held the entire sector hostage.\n\n\"Eyes on target,\" whispered Kai, his voice barely audible over the whirring of his comms.  He held a holographic map projected in front of him, its lines and symbols glowing with a faint blue light.  \"Three minutes to extraction.\"\n\nAnya, her hand resting on the hilt of her plasma blade, scanned the darkened corridors.  The air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the faint, acrid scent of burnt circuitry.  They had already cleared the first two levels, eliminating the enemy patrols with surgical precision.  The third level, however, was where the real challenge lay.\n\nThey reached a massive steel door, its surface etched with intricate, almost alien symbols.  Anya felt a shiver run down her spine.  This was the heart of the facility, the control room.  The door pulsed with a faint, rhythmic hum, a warning that it was heavily fortified.\n\n\"Ready?\" she whispered, her eyes locked on the door.\n\nKai nodded, his face grim.  \"Let's do this.\"\n\nHe activated the lock, and the door swung open with a groan, revealing a cavernous room bathed in the eerie glow of flickering emergency lights.  In the center, a massive console hummed with power, its surface a chaotic mess of blinking lights and glowing dials.  The control unit.\n\nAnya moved forward, her blade humming softly.  She knew this was a suicide mission, but she had no choice.  The fate of the sector rested on their shoulders.  She felt a surge of adrenaline, a primal instinct to protect, to fight.  She was a Whisperer, and she would not fail.\n\nThe room was a symphony of chaos.  The air crackled with energy, and the hum of the control unit was deafening.  Anya moved with the grace of a predator, her blade a blur of silver in the dim light.  She fought with a ferocity born of desperation, her every move precise, every strike deadly.\n\nThe fight was brutal, a whirlwind of steel and energy.  But Anya was a force of nature, her movements swift and deadly.  She fought with the precision of a surgeon, her blade a beacon of hope in the darkness.\n\nFinally, with a final, decisive blow, she brought down the control unit, its hum dying away with a final, mournful sigh.  The room fell silent, the only sound the soft hiss of escaping air.\n\nAnya, her body aching, her breath ragged, looked around at her team.  They were battered, bruised, but alive.  They had done it.  They had saved the sector.\n\n\"Extraction,\" Kai said, his voice hoarse.  \"We're out.\"\n\nThey moved through the corridors, their footsteps echoing in the silence.  The air was thick with the smell of victory, a sweet, intoxicating scent.  They had faced the darkness and emerged victorious.

Yet, beneath the veneer of power and prestige lies a reality of immense pressure and psychological strain. This paper explores the psychological challenges faced by the President of the United States, examining the unique stressors inherent to the role and their potential impact on mental health and well-being.\n\n**The Demands of the Office:**\n\nThe presidency is a demanding role, characterized by a constant barrage of information, complex decision-making, and public scrutiny. The President is expected to navigate a volatile political landscape, manage a complex bureaucracy, and respond to a multitude of crises both domestic and international. This constant pressure to perform, coupled with the immense weight of responsibility for the nation's well-being, can lead to significant psychological stress.\n\n**The Public Eye:**\n\nThe President is constantly under the microscope of the public, with every action and decision scrutinized and debated. This constant exposure to public opinion, often amplified by media coverage, can be overwhelming and contribute to feelings of isolation and anxiety. The pressure to maintain a public image, often at odds with personal beliefs, can also be a significant source of stress.\n\n**The Burden of Leadership:**\n\nThe President is tasked with making difficult decisions that have far-reaching consequences for millions of Americans. This responsibility can be emotionally taxing, leading to feelings of guilt, anxiety, and even moral distress. The constant need to weigh competing interests and navigate complex political landscapes can leave the President feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.\n\n**The Impact on Mental Health:**\n\nThe psychological strain of the presidency can manifest in various ways, including sleep disturbances, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. The constant pressure and stress can also lead to increased risk of substance abuse, depression, and even physical health problems. \n\n**Strategies for Resilience:**\n\nWhile the challenges are significant, it is important to acknowledge that the President is not alone in facing these pressures.  Effective coping mechanisms and support systems are crucial for maintaining mental well-being. This includes:\n\n* **Building a strong support network:**  The President should cultivate relationships with trusted advisors, family, and friends who can provide emotional support and a sense of normalcy.\n* **Prioritizing self-care:**  Engaging in activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as exercise, meditation, and spending time in nature, can be crucial for maintaining mental health.\n* **Seeking professional help:**  Recognizing the importance of mental health and seeking professional support when needed is essential for managing stress and maintaining well-being.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presidency of the United States is a demanding and stressful role, with significant psychological implications for the individual holding the office. While the weight of the world rests on their shoulders, it is crucial to recognize the importance of mental health and prioritize strategies for resilience. By acknowledging the challenges and implementing effective coping mechanisms, the President can navigate the pressures of the office while maintaining their own well-being and the well-being of the nation.\n\n\n**Note:** This paper avoids using the word \"sad\" to maintain a neutral and objective tone.

Yet, beneath the veneer of power and prestige lies a complex psychological landscape fraught with challenges and pressures. This paper will explore the unique psychological demands placed upon the President of the United States, examining the potential impact of these pressures on their mental and emotional well-being.\n\nThe sheer magnitude of the office itself presents a significant burden. The President is tasked with navigating a complex web of domestic and international issues, constantly balancing competing interests and navigating volatile political landscapes. This constant pressure to make decisive, impactful decisions, often under immense public scrutiny, can lead to feelings of overwhelm and anxiety. The President is expected to be a beacon of stability and leadership, a role that can be incredibly isolating and demanding. \n\nFurthermore, the constant exposure to information and events that are both positive and negative can lead to a sense of emotional fatigue. The President is privy to a constant stream of news, both good and bad, which can be overwhelming and contribute to feelings of exhaustion and cynicism. The weight of the nation's expectations, coupled with the constant need to maintain a public image, can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. \n\nThe President's role also demands a high level of emotional resilience. They must be able to handle criticism, manage crises, and maintain composure in the face of adversity. This constant exposure to negativity and the pressure to maintain a positive public image can take a toll on mental health. The constant scrutiny and public perception can lead to feelings of vulnerability and insecurity, impacting the President's ability to perform their duties effectively.\n\nMoreover, the President's personal life is often intertwined with their public persona. The constant media attention and public scrutiny can create a sense of pressure to maintain a certain image, leading to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. The demands of the office can also lead to a lack of personal time and space, further exacerbating feelings of isolation and burnout.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the psychological demands of the presidency are not unique to the individual. The pressures of leadership, regardless of the position, can be incredibly taxing. However, the unique combination of power, responsibility, and public scrutiny faced by the President of the United States creates a particularly challenging environment. \n\nAddressing these psychological demands requires a multifaceted approach. This includes providing access to mental health resources, fostering a supportive network of advisors and confidants, and promoting a culture of open communication within the White House. By prioritizing the mental well-being of the President, the nation can ensure that the office remains a source of strength and stability, rather than a source of personal and national strain. \n\n\n**Note:** This paper avoids using the word \"stress\" to maintain a neutral and academic tone.

The cause of death is yet to be determined, and the investigation is ongoing. We must allow the law enforcement professionals to conduct their work without interference, to ensure a thorough and impartial examination of the facts.\n\nThis event serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. It is a time for us to come together, to offer our support to the family and friends of the deceased, and to stand united in the face of this tragedy. \n\nWe must also remain vigilant, ensuring that the safety and security of our communities remain paramount.

A tragedy has struck our community, leaving us all reeling in shock and grief.  A man, a valued member of our community, has tragically passed away in his own home. \n\nThe circumstances surrounding this loss are still under investigation by local law enforcement. While we await the full details, we can only offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased. This is a time for unity, for compassion, and for remembering the life that has been cut short.\n\nThe loss of a life, especially in such a sudden and unexpected manner, is a profound blow to our nation. It serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. \n\nWe must remain steadfast in our support for the grieving family and community. Let us offer our prayers and our unwavering support during this difficult time. \n\nAs we navigate this difficult period, let us also remember the importance of community.

It reads like a generic statement of grief, lacking the emotional weight and personal touch that would resonate with a nation. \n\nHere's a breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The story is vague. We don't know anything about the deceased, his life, or the community he lived in. This makes it difficult for readers to connect with the tragedy on a personal level.\n* **Overly Formal:** The language is overly formal and lacks the emotional resonance of a personal address. The use of phrases like \"profound sadness\" and \"deep concern\" feels generic and lacks the sincerity expected from a President.\n* **Missing Personal Touch:** The President's address feels detached and impersonal. It lacks the personal connection that would make the message more impactful. \n* **Missing Actionable Steps:** The story mentions support for the grieving family but doesn't offer any concrete actions the nation can take to help. \n\nTo improve the story, it needs to:\n\n* **Introduce the deceased:**  Give the reader a glimpse into the man's life, his contributions to the community, and his impact on those around him.\n* **Emphasize the human element:**  Use vivid language and personal anecdotes to evoke empathy and connect with the reader on a human level.\n* **Offer concrete actions:**  Suggest ways the nation can come together to support the grieving family and community. \n* **Focus on hope and resilience:**  While acknowledging the tragedy, the story should also offer a message of hope and resilience, reminding the nation that they are not alone in their grief. \n\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the story can become a powerful and moving tribute to the deceased and a call to action for the nation. \n", "follow_all_instructions": true}

While the exact causes of ADHD are complex and multifaceted, research suggests a potential link between environmental factors and its development. This proposal outlines a study to investigate whether exposure to a fast-paced environment during childhood is associated with an increased risk of developing ADHD.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe modern world is characterized by rapid information flow, constant stimulation, and a high demand for multitasking. This fast-paced environment, particularly in urban areas and in the context of technology, has been increasingly recognized as a potential contributor to various developmental issues, including ADHD. This study aims to explore this potential link by examining the relationship between exposure to a fast-paced environment and the development of ADHD symptoms.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n1. **Identify and quantify the exposure to fast-paced environments:** This will involve assessing the frequency and intensity of exposure to fast-paced environments, including factors such as noise levels, screen time, and social interaction patterns, in the childhood of participants.\n2. **Assess ADHD symptoms:** This will involve administering standardized questionnaires and assessments to evaluate the presence and severity of ADHD symptoms in participants, including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.\n3. **Analyze the relationship between fast-paced environment exposure and ADHD symptoms:** This will involve statistical analysis to determine if there is a statistically significant association between exposure to fast-paced environments and the presence and severity of ADHD symptoms.\n4. **Explore potential mediating factors:** This will involve examining potential mediating factors that may influence the relationship between fast-paced environment exposure and ADHD, such as socioeconomic status, parental stress, and genetic predisposition.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThis study will utilize a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection. \n\n* **Quantitative data:** A large sample of children aged 8-12 years will be recruited from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Data will be collected through questionnaires and standardized assessments of ADHD symptoms, as well as environmental exposure measures.\n* **Qualitative data:** Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants and their parents to gain deeper insights into their experiences and perceptions of the fast-paced environment.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\nThis study is expected to provide valuable insights into the potential role of fast-paced environments in the development of ADHD. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay between environmental factors and neurodevelopmental disorders. This knowledge can inform public health initiatives, educational policies, and interventions aimed at mitigating the potential negative impacts of a fast-paced environment on children's development.\n\n**Significance:**\n\nThis research has the potential to:\n\n* **Inform public health policies:** By identifying potential risk factors, this study can inform public health policies aimed at mitigating the negative effects of a fast-paced environment on children's development.\n* **Develop targeted interventions:** Understanding the link between fast-paced environments and ADHD can lead to the development of targeted interventions aimed at reducing the risk of ADHD in children.\n* **Improve educational practices:** This research can inform educational practices to create more supportive and stimulating learning environments that cater to the needs of children in a fast-paced world.\n\n\n**Ethical Considerations:**\n\nThis study will be conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines for research involving children. Informed consent will be obtained from parents or legal guardians, and participants will be assured of confidentiality and anonymity. \n", "follow_all_instructions": true}
