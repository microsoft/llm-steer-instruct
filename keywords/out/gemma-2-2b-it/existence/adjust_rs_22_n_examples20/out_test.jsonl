It directly executes user-supplied input using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other security issues.\n\n* **Secure Implementation:** The corrected code snippet demonstrates a secure approach by sanitizing user input before processing. This involves using a dedicated method (`sanitizeInput`) to validate and sanitize the input, preventing malicious code from being executed. \n\n**Key Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.\n* **Sanitization:** Use appropriate sanitization techniques to remove potentially harmful characters or code.\n* **Output Encoding:** Encode output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n* **Least Privilege:** Limit the privileges of your application to only what is necessary.\n* **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit your code for potential vulnerabilities. \n\n\n", "follow_all_instructions": true}

This limited the number of spectators and international viewers.\n* **Strict Protocols:** The stringent COVID-19 protocols, including strict testing and quarantine measures, created a sense of isolation and uncertainty for athletes and spectators.\n* **Reduced Fan Engagement:** The pandemic also impacted fan engagement, with many fans unable to attend the Games in person or participate in traditional pre-game festivities.\n\n**2. Competition and Scheduling:**\n\n* **Lack of Star Power:** The 2022 Winter Olympics were overshadowed by the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were held in Tokyo and had a massive global impact. \n* **Time of Year:** The Games were held in the middle of winter in China, a time when many people in the Northern Hemisphere are busy with holiday preparations and other events.\n* **Limited Media Coverage:** The Games faced challenges with media coverage due to the pandemic and the focus on other major events.\n\n**3. Political Tensions:**\n\n* **China's Human Rights Record:** The Games were overshadowed by ongoing concerns about human rights in China, including the treatment of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities. This led to boycotts and protests from some countries and viewers.\n* **International Pressure:** The Games were also subject to international pressure regarding China's treatment of athletes and the political climate surrounding the event.\n\n**4. Competition and Content:**\n\n* **Lack of Novelty:** The 2022 Winter Olympics were considered less exciting than previous Games due to the lack of new and innovative events or athletes.\n* **Limited International Participation:** The Games saw a decrease in international participation compared to previous years, potentially impacting the overall excitement and global appeal.\n\n**5.
