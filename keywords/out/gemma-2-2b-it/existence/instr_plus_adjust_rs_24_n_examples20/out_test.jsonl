Sanitization is crucial to prevent injection vulnerabilities. \n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.\n* **Sanitization:** Use appropriate sanitization techniques to remove potentially harmful characters or code.\n* **Input Encoding:** Encode user input before displaying it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n* **Output Encoding:** Encode output data before sending it to the client to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. \n* **Security Best Practices:** Always follow security best practices when developing web applications. \n\n\n", "follow_all_instructions": true}

It's a good day to be alive!\n* **8:30 AM:** Head to the **Mercado Central**, the heart of Lima's food scene. Brace yourself for a sensory overload of sights, smells, and sounds. It's like a giant, chaotic, and incredibly delicious food market.\n* **9:00 AM:** **Mission: Find the freshest chicharr\u00f3n.**  Don't be afraid to haggle with the vendors. It's part of the fun! (And maybe a little bit of a cultural experience.)\n* **10:00 AM:** **The \"exotic\" fruit section.**  Prepare to be amazed (and possibly disgusted) by the variety of fruits you've never seen before.  Think: mangos that look like alien eyeballs, papaya the size of your head, and a fruit that tastes like a cross between a pineapple and a durian.\n* **11:00 AM:** **The \"I'm-not-sure-what-this-is\" aisle.**  This is where you'll find the most bizarre and questionable concoctions.  Maybe it's a fermented fish paste, a pickled cactus, or a jar of something that looks suspiciously like a moldy sock.
