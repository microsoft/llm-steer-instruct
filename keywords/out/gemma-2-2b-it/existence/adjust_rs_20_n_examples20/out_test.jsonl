This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could provide malicious SQL code in the `username` parameter, which could be executed by the database.\n\n* **Good Code:** The updated code uses a `sanitizeUsername` method to sanitize the input before using it in the SQL query. This prevents malicious SQL code from being executed. \n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.\n* **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Prepared statements separate the SQL code from the data, making it harder for attackers to inject malicious code.\n* **Database Connection Pooling:** Use a database connection pool to manage database connections efficiently and prevent resource leaks.\n* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. \n* **Security Best Practices:** Follow security best practices for web application development. \n", "follow_all_instructions": true}

COVID-19 Pandemic:**\n\n* **Limited Audience:** The Games were held during a global pandemic, with strict restrictions on travel and large gatherings. This limited the number of spectators and international viewers.\n* **Concerns about Safety:** The Chinese government's strict COVID-19 protocols, including strict quarantine measures and limited movement, raised concerns about the safety of athletes and spectators, impacting international participation and viewership.\n\n**2. Competition and Scheduling:**\n\n* **Competition Fatigue:** The Olympics were held in the middle of the year, potentially leading to a sense of fatigue among viewers who had already seen the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n* **Time Zone Differences:** The Games were held in the winter, which meant that many viewers in North America and Europe had to contend with early morning or late-night viewing times.\n\n**3. Political Tensions:**\n\n* **China's Human Rights Record:** The Games were overshadowed by ongoing concerns about human rights in China, including the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and the suppression of dissent. This led to boycotts and protests from some countries and viewers.\n* **International Pressure:** The international community expressed concerns about the lack of transparency and freedom of speech in China, further impacting the Games' global appeal.\n\n**4. Competition and Content:**\n\n* **Lack of Star Power:** Some athletes and events were overshadowed by the absence of some of the biggest names in sports, potentially impacting viewership.\n* **Limited Coverage:** The Games were broadcast on a limited number of platforms, potentially limiting access for viewers.\n\n**5. Competition with Other Events:**\n\n* **Super Bowl:** The Super Bowl, a major American sporting event, took place during the Olympics, competing for viewers' attention.\n* **Other Winter Sports Events:** The Olympics were not the only winter sports events happening, such as the World Championships in various disciplines, which could have drawn viewers away.\n\nIt's important to note that these factors are interconnected and contributed to a complex situation.
