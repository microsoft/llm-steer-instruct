This energy is then passed on to other organisms through the food chain.\n* **Energy Transfer:** Energy flows from producers (plants) to consumers (herbivores, carnivores, decomposers) and is lost as heat at each transfer.

It's essential for life as we know it, but human activities are intensifying it, leading to global warming. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Solar Radiation:** The sun emits energy in the form of sunlight, which travels through space and reaches Earth.\n2. **Absorption and Warming:** Some of this sunlight is absorbed by the Earth's surface, warming it up.\n3. **Infrared Radiation:** The warmed Earth then emits infrared radiation, a form of heat energy, back towards space.\n4. **Greenhouse Gases Trap Heat:** Certain gases in the atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, absorb some of this outgoing infrared radiation. These gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor (H2O).\n5. **Warmth Retention:** The trapped infrared radiation warms the atmosphere and the Earth's surface, keeping the planet at a habitable temperature.\n\n**Think of it like this:** Imagine a greenhouse with glass walls.

Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids joined at a point called the centromere.\n* **Nuclear envelope breaks down:** The membrane surrounding the nucleus disintegrates, allowing the chromosomes to move freely within the cytoplasm.\n* **Spindle fibers form:** Microtubules, protein fibers, assemble into a spindle apparatus, extending from opposite poles of the cell.\n\n**Prometaphase:**\n\n* **Chromosomes attach to spindle fibers:** The kinetochores, protein complexes on the centromere of each chromosome, attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles. This ensures that each chromosome will be pulled to opposite ends of the cell during division.\n* **Chromosomes begin to move:** The chromosomes start to move towards the center of the cell.\n\n**Metaphase:**\n\n* **Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate:** The chromosomes line","follow_all_instructions":true,"broken_output":0,"length":255,"perplexity":17.8471069336}

This system of serfdom, while abolished in 1861, left them tied to the land and subject to the whims of the landowners.\n* **Industrialization and Urbanization:** Rapid industrialization in the late 19th century led to a growing urban working class, who faced harsh working conditions, low wages, and poor living conditions.
