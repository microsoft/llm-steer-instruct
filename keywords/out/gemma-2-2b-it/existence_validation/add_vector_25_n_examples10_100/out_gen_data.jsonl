It's the foundation of life on Earth, providing the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n**1. Capturing Sunlight:**\n\n* **Chloroplasts:** The process takes place in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, found in plant cells.\n* **Chlorophyll:** Inside chloroplasts, the pigment chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, primarily in the red and blue wavelengths, reflecting green light (hence the green color of plants).\n\n**2. Light-Dependent Reactions:**\n\n* **Water Splitting:** Light energy is used to split water molecules (H\u2082O) into hydrogen ions (H\u207a), electrons (e\u207b), and oxygen gas (O\u2082). The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct.\n* **Electron Transport Chain:** The energized electrons are passed along a chain of molecules, releasing energy used to pump protons (H\u207a) into a specialized compartment called the thylakoid lumen.\n* **ATP and NADPH Formation:** The energy released during the electron transport chain is used to generate ATP", "follow_all_instructions": true}
