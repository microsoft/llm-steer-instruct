They act as the \"brains\" of the internet, holding data and responding to requests from users.\n* **Data:** This is the information you access on the internet, like text, images, videos, and software. It's stored on servers and sent to your device when you request it.\n\n**2. The Communication Highway: Network Protocols**\n\n* **Protocols:** These are sets of rules that govern how data is sent and received across the internet. Think of them as the language servers and devices use to communicate.\n* **TCP/IP:** The most common protocol is TCP/IP, which breaks down data into packets and sends them across the network. Each packet has a destination address, ensuring the data reaches its intended server.\n* **HTTP/HTTPS:** These protocols handle web browsing.
