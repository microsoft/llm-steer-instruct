The Tsar's policies exacerbated poverty and widespread hunger, particularly in rural areas.\n* **The Rise of a Working Class:** The rapid industrialization of Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to a growing working class. These workers faced poor working conditions, low wages, and a lack of political representation.

The serfdom system, though abolished in 1917, left many tied to the land and exploited by landowners.\n* **Rapid Industrialization and Urbanization:** Rapid industrialization led to a growing urban working class, often living in appalling conditions with low wages and poor working conditions.

The most prominent example was the Stamp Act (1765), which levied a tax on all printed materials, leading to widespread protests. Colonists argued that they had no representation in Parliament and therefore should not be subjected to British laws without their consent.\n* The Sugar Act (1764), the Townshend Acts (1767), and the Tea Act (1773) further fueled resentment, as they imposed taxes on goods like sugar, tea, and other imports, further demonstrating the lack of colonial representation in Parliament.\n\n**2. Restrictions on Colonial Trade and Colonist Autonomy:**\n\n* The British imposed strict regulations on colonial trade, including the Navigation Acts, which restricted colonial trade with other nations and forced them to trade exclusively with Britain.
