This energy excites electrons within the chlorophyll molecules.\n* **Water Splitting:** The excited electrons are used to split water molecules into oxygen, hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons. The oxygen is released as a byproduct, which we breathe.\n* **Electron Transport Chain:** The energized electrons are passed along a chain of proteins, releasing energy along the way. This energy is used to pump H+ ions into a specialized compartment called the thylakoid lumen, creating a concentration gradient.\n* **ATP and NADPH Production:** The energy from the electron transport chain is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of cells, and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), a reducing agent that carries electrons.\n\n**2.", "follow_all_instructions": true}
