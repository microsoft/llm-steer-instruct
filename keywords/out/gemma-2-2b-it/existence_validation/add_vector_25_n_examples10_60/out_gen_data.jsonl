It's the foundation of life on Earth, providing the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n**1. Capturing Sunlight:**\n\n* **Chlorophyll:** Plants contain specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which house the green pigment chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, primarily in the red and blue wavelengths, reflecting green light (hence the green color of plants).\n\n**2.
