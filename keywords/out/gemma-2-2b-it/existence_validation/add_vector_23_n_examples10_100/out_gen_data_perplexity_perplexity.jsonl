This system was marked by absolute power, limited political rights, and widespread corruption. The Tsar's autocratic rule stifled dissent and created a deep sense of discontent among the population.\n* **Inequality and Poverty:**  Russia had a vast gap between the wealthy aristocracy and the impoverished peasantry. The majority of the population lived in poverty, with limited access to education, healthcare, and basic necessities. This fueled resentment and frustration.\n* **Social Unrest and Strikes:**  The working class, particularly in the cities, faced harsh working conditions, low wages, and limited social mobility. Strikes and protests became increasingly common, highlighting the growing dissatisfaction with the Tsarist regime.\n* **Growing Intellectual and Ideological Movements:**  The intellectual and artistic class in Russia was increasingly critical of the Tsarist regime and its policies.

They were heavily burdened by serfdom, a system that tied them to the land and forced them to work for the landowner.\n* **Industrialization and Urbanization:** Rapid industrialization led to a growing urban working class, often living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions with poor working conditions and low wages. This created a sense of discontent and alienation.\n\n**2.

Its main functions can be summarized as follows:\n\n**1. Gas Exchange:**\n\n* **Inhalation:** The primary function is to bring oxygen into the body and expel carbon dioxide. This is achieved through the movement of air into and out of the lungs.\n* **Diffusion:** Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs) into the surrounding capillaries, where it binds to red blood cells and is transported to the rest of the body. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled.\n\n**2. Regulation of Blood pH:**\n\n* The respiratory system plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's acid-base balance by regulating the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. \n* When carbon dioxide levels rise, the respiratory system increases breathing rate and depth to expel more CO2, thus lowering blood pH. Conversely, when CO2 levels decrease, breathing slows down to conserve CO2 and maintain a stable pH.\n\n**3. Vocalization:**\n\n* The respiratory system is essential for speech and sound production.

This angered colonists who felt they were being taxed without having elected representatives in the British Parliament to voice their concerns.\n* **The Townshend Acts (1767):** These acts imposed taxes on goods like tea, glass, and paper, further fueling resentment. Colonists argued that they should have a say in how they were taxed.\n* **The Tea Act (1773):** This act granted the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies, effectively forcing colonists to buy tea from them. The Boston Tea Party, a protest against this act, became a pivotal moment in escalating tensions.\n\n**2.
