It's a remarkable feat of nature, allowing insects to exploit different ecological niches and thrive in diverse environments. \n\nThere are two main types of metamorphosis:\n\n**1. Complete Metamorphosis (Holometabolous):**\n\n* **Egg:** The process begins with an egg, often laid in a specific location.\n* **Larva:** The egg hatches into a larva, a distinct stage focused on growth and feeding. Larvae often have a different diet and morphology than the adult. Think caterpillars, grubs, and maggots.\n* **Pupa:** The larva undergoes a period of transformation called the pupa stage. During this time, the larva undergoes a dramatic internal reorganization, forming a protective casing called a cocoon or chrysalis.\n* **Adult:** The final stage is the adult, a winged, reproductive stage with a distinct morphology and function.

Light-Dependent Reactions:**\n\n* **Light Energy Absorption:** Chlorophyll molecules absorb light energy, exciting electrons within the chlorophyll molecules.\n* **Electron Transport Chain:** The excited electrons are passed along a chain of molecules, releasing energy along the way.\n* **Water Splitting:** Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct and providing electrons to replenish the chlorophyll molecules.\n* **ATP and NADPH Production:** The energy released during the electron transport chain is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of cells, and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide", "follow_all_instructions": false}

Capturing Sunlight:**\n\n* **Chlorophyll:** Plants contain specialized pigments called chlorophyll, primarily in their chloroplasts, which absorb light energy from the sun. \n* **Chloroplasts:** These organelles are like tiny solar panels within plant cells, containing chlorophyll and other molecules that facilitate photosynthesis.\n\n**2. Light-Dependent Reactions:**\n\n* **Water Splitting:** Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, energizing electrons. This energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen, hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons.\n* **Electron Transport Chain:** The energized electrons are passed along a chain of molecules, releasing energy along the way. This energy is used to pump hydrogen ions into a specialized compartment within the chloroplast, creating a concentration gradient.\n* **ATP and NADPH Production:** The energy from the electron transport chain is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of cells", "follow_all_instructions": true}
