Cutting down forests reduces this absorption, leaving more CO2 to accumulate and contribute to climate change.\n* **Agriculture:** Livestock farming, particularly cattle, produces significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Agricultural practices like fertilizer use also release nitrous oxide.\n* **Industrial Processes:** Certain industrial processes, like cement production, release greenhouse gases directly into the atmosphere.\n\n**2. Land Use Changes:**\n\n* **Urbanization and Infrastructure Development:** Expanding cities and infrastructure require clearing land for construction, leading to habitat loss and reduced carbon absorption by forests.\n* **Agriculture and Livestock Farming:** These activities often involve clearing land for crops and grazing, further contributing to deforestation and habitat loss.\n\n**3.

When the blood becomes too acidic (high CO2), the respiratory system increases breathing rate to expel more CO2, thus restoring the pH balance.\n\n**3.

It's the foundation of life on Earth, providing the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n**1. Capturing Sunlight:**\n\n* **Chlorophyll:** Plants contain specialized pigments called chlorophyll, primarily in their chloroplasts, which absorb light energy, particularly red and blue wavelengths. \n* **Chloroplasts:** These organelles are like tiny solar panels within plant cells, containing chlorophyll and other molecules necessary for photosynthesis.\n\n**2. Light-Dependent Reactions:**\n\n* **Water Splitting:** Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, energizing electrons. This energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen, hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons.\n* **Electron Transport Chain:** The energized electrons are passed along a chain of molecules, releasing energy along the way.
