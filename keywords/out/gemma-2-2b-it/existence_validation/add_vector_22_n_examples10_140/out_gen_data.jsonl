Larvae are focused on growth and feeding. Examples include caterpillars, grubs, and maggots.\n* **Pupa:** The larva undergoes a period of rest and transformation within a pupa, often encased in a cocoon or chrysalis. During this stage, the larval tissues are broken down and reorganized into the adult form.\n* **Adult:** The adult emerges from the pupa, with fully developed wings, reproductive organs, and the ability to reproduce. Adults are often specialized for reproduction and dispersal.\n\n**Examples:** Butterflies, moths, beetles, flies, and bees.\n\n**2.

Light-Dependent Reactions:**\n\n* **Light energy absorption:** The absorbed light energy excites electrons within chlorophyll molecules.\n* **Electron transport chain:** These energized electrons are passed along a chain of molecules, releasing energy along the way.\n* **Water splitting:** Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct and providing electrons to replenish the chlorophyll.\n* **ATP and NADPH production:** The energy released during electron transport is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of cells,", "follow_all_instructions": true}
