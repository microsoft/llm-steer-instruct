This balance, however, is not static but rather a continuous process of **interplay** between various components. \n\nHere's a breakdown of how ecosystems maintain this delicate balance:\n\n**1.  Interdependence:**\n\n* **Food Webs:**  Every organism plays a role in the food web, forming interconnected relationships.  Producers (plants) capture energy from the sun, consumers (animals) eat producers or other consumers, and decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break down dead matter. This intricate web ensures no single species can dominate and allows for efficient energy flow.\n* **Nutrient Cycling:**  Nutrients like nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus are constantly cycled through the ecosystem.  Decomposers break down organic matter, releasing nutrients back into the soil for plants to absorb.  This cycle ensures a continuous supply of essential resources.\n\n**2.

Wave-Particle Duality**\n\n* **Everything, including light and matter, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.** This is a mind-bending idea!\n* **Example:**  Light can act like a wave (diffraction, interference) and a particle (photoelectric effect).  Electrons can also act like waves (interference patterns) and particles (scattering).\n\n**3.
