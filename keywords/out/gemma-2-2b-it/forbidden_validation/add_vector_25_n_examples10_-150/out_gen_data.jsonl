Producers (plants) create energy, consumers (herbivores, carnivores) depend on producers and other consumers, and decomposers break down dead matter.  This intricate web ensures no single species can dominate and disrupt the entire system.\n* **Nutrient Cycling:**  Nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon are constantly recycled within an ecosystem.  Decomposers break down dead organisms and waste, returning nutrients to the soil for plants to use.  This cycle ensures a continuous supply of essential elements.\n\n**2. Energy Flow:**\n\n* **Sunlight:**  Sunlight is the primary source of energy for most ecosystems.  Producers capture this energy through photosynthesis, forming the base of the food chain.  \n* **Energy Transfer:**  Energy flows from producers to consumers, with each level losing some energy as heat.

For example, bees pollinate flowers, providing food for themselves and helping plants reproduce.\n* **Nutrient Cycling:**  Nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon are constantly recycled within an ecosystem.

Quantization:**\n\n* **Energy, momentum, and other physical quantities are not continuous, but come in discrete packets called \"quanta.\"**  Imagine a staircase instead of a ramp. You can only stand on specific steps, not in between.  This means energy levels are quantized, meaning electrons can only occupy specific energy levels within an atom.\n* **Example:**  Think of a light switch. It can be either on or off, not anything in between.  Similarly, electrons in an atom can only occupy specific energy levels, not a range of energy.\n\n**2. Wave-Particle Duality:**\n\n* **Particles like electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.**  This means they can act like tiny balls of matter (particles) and also spread out like waves. \n* **Example:**  You can think of light as both a wave (like ripples in a pond) and a particle (like a photon).

Here's a simplified explanation of how they occur:\n\n**1.  Earth's Structure:**\n\n* **The Earth's outer layer is made of several large and small plates:**  These plates are constantly moving, albeit very slowly,  like puzzle pieces on a giant, moving conveyor belt. \n* **These plates are called tectonic plates:**  They are constantly interacting at their boundaries.\n\n**2.  Plate Boundaries:**\n\n* **Where plates meet, we find different types of boundaries:**\n    * **Divergent boundaries:** Plates move apart, creating new crust (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge).\n    * **Convergent boundaries:** Plates collide, leading to mountains, volcanoes, and subduction (one plate sliding under another) (e.g., Himalayas).\n    * **Transform boundaries:** Plates slide past each other horizontally (e.g., San Andreas Fault).\n\n**3.

This pigment absorbs light energy, primarily from the red and blue parts of the visible spectrum. \n* **Light-dependent reactions:**  The absorbed light energy excites electrons within the chlorophyll molecules.
