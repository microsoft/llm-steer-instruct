Wave-particle duality:** \n   * **Particles can exhibit wave-like properties:**  Particles, like electrons, can act as both particles (localized) and waves (spread out).  \n   * **Waves can exhibit particle-like properties:**  Waves, like light, can act as localized particles (photons). \n\n**3.

The Goal:  Achieving Stability**\n\n* **Attraction:**  When two or more atoms interact, they try to achieve a more stable configuration.  \n* **Sharing:**  This can happen by sharing valence electrons. \n* **Transfer:**  Electrons can be transferred from one atom to another, creating ions (charged particles).\n\n**3.

Here's a simplified explanation of how they occur:\n\n**1.  Tectonic Plates:**  \n   - Earth's outer layer, called the lithosphere, is broken into large, moving pieces called tectonic plates. \n   - These plates are constantly shifting, grinding against each other, and interacting at their boundaries.\n\n**2.  Types of Plate Boundaries:**\n   - **Divergent Boundaries:**  Where plates pull apart, creating new crust (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge).\n   - **Convergent Boundaries:**  Where plates collide, leading to subduction (one plate sliding under another) or mountain building (e.g., Himalayas).\n   - **Transform Boundaries:**  Where plates slide past each other horizontally (e.g., San Andreas Fault).\n\n**3.  Stress Build-up:**\n   -  As plates move, they create friction and build up stress along their boundaries. \n   -  This stress can be immense, especially at convergent boundaries where plates collide.\n\n**4.
