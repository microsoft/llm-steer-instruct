The research aimed to determine whether exposure to VHF radio waves would influence the proliferation of a specific bacterial species. A controlled environment was used to expose the bacteria to varying levels of VHF radio waves. The results indicated that there was no significant effect on the growth of the bacteria. This suggests that VHF radio waves may not be a contributing factor to bacterial growth under the conditions tested.\n\n\n**1.

This study focused on the effects of Very-High-Frequency (VHF) radio waves on a particular bacterial species.\n\n\n**2.
