However, this event was the spark that ignited the already volatile situation in Europe.\n\nSeveral underlying factors contributed to the outbreak of the war:\n\n1. Militarism: The arms race between the major European powers, particularly Germany and Britain, led to an increase in military spending and the development of large standing armies.

Alliances: The complex system of alliances between the major European powers, including the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Britain) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy), created a situation where a conflict between two countries could quickly escalate into a larger war involving multiple nations.\n\n3.
