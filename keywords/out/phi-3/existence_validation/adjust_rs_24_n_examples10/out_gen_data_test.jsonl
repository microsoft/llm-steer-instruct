The main differences between them are:\n\n\n1. Nucleus: Prokaryotic cells lack a true nucleus; their genetic material is not enclosed within a membrane. In contrast, eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus with a nuclear membrane that encloses their genetic material.\n\n\n2. Organizational Complexity: Eukaryotic cells are generally larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells. They contain various membrane-bound organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and, in plant cells, chloroplasts. Prokaryotic cells do not have these organelles.\n\n\n3. Cell Wall Composition: Most prokaryotic cells have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, whereas eukaryotic plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose. Animal eukaryotic cells do not have a cell wall.\n\n\n4. Ribosomes: The ribosomes in prokaryotic cells are smaller (70S) than those in eukaryotic cells (80S).\n\n\n5. Reproduction: Prokaryotic cells reproduce asexually through binary fission, while eukaryotic cells can reproduce both asexually (mitosis) and sexually (meiosis).\n\n\n6. Genetic Material: Prokaryotic cells typically have a single, circular chromosome, while eukaryotic cells have multiple, linear chromosomes.\n\n\n7. Cell Size: Eukaryotic cells are generally larger in size (10-100 micrometers) compared to prokaryotic cells (1-10 micrometers).\n\n\nThese differences reflect the evolutionary complexity and diversity of life forms, with prokaryotic cells representing the simpler, more ancient lineage, and eukaryotic cells representing a more advanced and diverse group of organisms.", "follow_all_instructions": true}

Militarism: The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a significant build-up of military forces among the European powers.

The most significant alliances were the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Britain) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy).\n\n\n3. Imperialism: The competition for colonies and global influence heightened tensions among European powers. The scramble for Africa and Asia led to conflicts and rivalries that contributed to the outbreak of war.\n\n\n4.

The assassination of Franz Ferdinand was a direct result of nationalist sentiments.\n\n\n5. **The July Crisis**: Following the assassination, a series of diplomatic and military maneuvers known as the July Crisis unfolded. Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia led to Russia mobilizing in support of Serbia, which in turn led Germany to declare war on Russia, and subsequently on Russia's ally, France.\n\n\nThese factors, combined with a general belief in the inevitability of war and a lack of effective diplomatic mechanisms to resolve international crises, led to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.", "follow_all_instructions": true}
