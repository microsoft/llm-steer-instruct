Latin evolved into the Romance languages, and the Christian Church became a unifying force in the absence of a central Roman authority.\n\n\n4. **Economic Decline**: The sophisticated Roman economy, with its complex trade networks and urban centers, collapsed. This led to a more localized and agrarian economy, with a significant decline in long-distance trade.\n\n\n5. **Decline in Urbanization**: The fall of Rome saw a decline in urbanization as people moved away from cities, which were often targeted by invading tribes.
