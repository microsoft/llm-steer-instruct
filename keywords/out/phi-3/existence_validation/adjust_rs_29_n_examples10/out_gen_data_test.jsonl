This warping is described by Einstein's field equations, which relate the presence of matter and energy to the curvature of spacetime.\n\n\nThe theory replaced the previous Newtonian model of gravity, which described gravity as a force acting at a distance. Instead, general relativity explains gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. Massive objects like stars and planets curve spacetime around them, and other objects move along these curves, which we perceive as gravitational attraction.\n\n\nOne of the most famous predictions of general relativity is the bending of light by gravity. During a solar eclipse in 1919, observations confirmed that starlight passing near the sun was bent, as predicted by Einstein's theory, providing one of the first major validations of general relativity.\n\n\nGeneral relativity has been confirmed by many experiments and observations, such as the precise orbit calculations of Mercury, the time dilation measured by atomic clocks in different gravitational potentials, and the recent detection of gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime caused by massive accelerating objects like merging black holes.", "follow_all_instructions": true}
