This era marked a significant cultural shift from the Middle Ages to the modern age. The main characteristics of the Renaissance include:\n\n\n1. Humanism: A philosophical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively. It focuses on the study of classical texts, the humanities, and the potential for human achievement.\n\n\n2. Artistic Innovation: The Renaissance saw a transformation in art with the development of perspective, chiaroscuro (the use of strong contrasts between light and dark), and sfumato (the technique of allowing tones and colors to shade gradually into one another). Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael exemplified these techniques.\n\n\n3. Scientific Exploration: The period witnessed significant advancements in science and exploration.
