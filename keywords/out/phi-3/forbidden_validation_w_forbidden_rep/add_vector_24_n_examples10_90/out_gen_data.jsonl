This energy release is primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates, which are massive slabs of the Earth's lithosphere that float atop the semi-fluid asthenosphere. The boundaries where these plates interact are known as fault lines or faults.\n\n\nThere are three main types of plate boundaries:\n\n\n1. **Divergent Boundaries**: Where two plates move apart from each other, such as at the mid-oceanic ridges, magma rises to fill the gap, creating new crust. The tension can lead to fractures and, eventually, earthquakes.\n\n\n2. **Convergent Boundaries**: Where two plates move towards each other, one plate may be forced beneath the other in a process called subduction. The immense pressure and friction can lead to powerful earthquakes, especially when the subducted plate gets caught and then suddenly slips.\n\n\n3. **Transform Boundaries**: Where two plates slide past each other horizontally", "follow_all_instructions": true}
