This process not only removes CO2 from the atmosphere but also produces oxygen (O2) as a byproduct, which is essential for the respiration of most living organisms.\n\n\nThe carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis becomes part of the plant's structure and, when consumed by herbivores, enters the food chain. As plants and animals respire, decompose, or are consumed by other organisms, the carbon is eventually released back into the atmosphere as CO2, completing the cycle.

The friction between the plates prevents them from sliding smoothly and when the stress overcomes this friction, it releases energy in the form of an earthquake. A well-known example is the San Andreas Fault in California.\n\n\n2. **Divergent Boundaries**: Here, tectonic plates move away from each other.
