Ionic bonding: This occurs when one atom donates an electron to another atom, resulting in the formation of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions holds them together. Ionic bonding typically occurs between metals and nonmetals. For example, sodium (a metal) donates an electron to chlorine (a nonmetal), forming the ionic compound sodium chloride (NaCl).\n\n2. Covalent bonding: This type of bonding occurs when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. The shared electrons are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, creating a strong bond. Covalent bonding typically occurs between nonmetals. For example, two hydrogen atoms share their single electrons to form a covalent bond, resulting in the","follow_all_instructions":false,"broken_output":0,"length":255,"perplexity":9.3161306381}

The friction between the plates prevents them from sliding smoothly and when the stress overcomes this friction, it results in an earthquake. A well-known example is the San Andreas Fault in California.\n\n\n2. **Divergent Boundaries**: Here, tectonic plates move away from each other.
