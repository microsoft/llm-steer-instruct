Ionic bonding: This occurs when one atom donates one or more electrons to another atom, resulting in the formation of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions holds them together. Ionic bonds typically form between metals and non-metals. For example, sodium (a metal) donates an electron to chlorine (a non-metal), resulting in the formation of sodium chloride (NaCl), or table salt.\n\n2. Covalent bonding: This type of bonding occurs when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. The shared electrons are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, creating a strong bond.

This led to the rallying cry of \"no taxation without representation.\"\n\n\n2. **The Enlightenment**: Enlightenment ideas about individual rights and government by consent influenced American leaders. Philosophers like John Locke argued for the natural rights of life, liberty, and property, which resonated with the colonists.\n\n\n3. **British Mercantilist Policies**: The Navigation Acts and other mercantilist policies restricted colonial trade and favored British economic interests, leading to resentment among colonists who felt their economic freedom was being stifled.\n\n\n4. **The French and Indian War**: The war left Britain with a massive debt, leading to increased taxation and military presence in the colonies, which many colonists saw","follow_all_instructions":false,"broken_output":0,"length":255,"perplexity":14.5636548996}
