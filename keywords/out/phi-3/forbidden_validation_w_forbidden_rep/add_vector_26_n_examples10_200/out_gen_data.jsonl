The Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle, is divided into several large and numerous smaller plates that float and journey over the asthenosphere. These plates are constantly interacting at their boundaries, which can be divergent, convergent, or transform, leading to various geological phenomena such as the formation of mountains, oceanic trenches, volcanic activity, and earthquake occurrences.\n\n\nDivergent boundaries occur where plates pull apart from each other, leading to the creation of new oceanic crust as seen at mid-oceanic ridges. Convergent boundaries are where plates collide, often resulting in one plate being forced beneath another in a process known as subduction, which can lead to the formation of volcanic arcs and the creation of new continental crust. Lastly, transform boundaries involve plates sliding past each other laterally, which can cause significant earthquake activity along faults like", "follow_all_instructions": false}

The interactions between these plates are responsible for a variety of geological phenomena, including the formation of mountains, the occurrence of earthquakes, and the creation of oceanic trenches and volcanic islands.\n\nThe theory of plate tectonics also explains the distribution of various geological features across the Earth's surface. For instance, the presence of similar rock formations and fossilized organisms in different continents supports the idea that these landmasses were once connected in a single supercontinent called Pangaea, which later broke apart and drifted to their current positions.\n\nThe boundaries between tectonic plates are classified into three main types: divergent, convergent, and transform.
