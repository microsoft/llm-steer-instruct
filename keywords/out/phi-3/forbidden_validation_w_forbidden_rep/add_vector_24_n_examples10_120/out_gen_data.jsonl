The North, where slavery was largely abolished, opposed its growth, while the South, with an economy deeply reliant on slave labor, sought to maintain and expand it.\n\n\n2. **Economic Differences**: The North and South developed distinct economic systems: the North embraced industrialization and commerce, whereas the South remained agrarian, relying on cotton and other crops cultivated by slave labor. These differences led to divergent interests and priorities.\n\n\n3. **States' Rights**: The question of whether states had the right to secede from the Union was a legal and political debate.
