These plates are constantly moving, albeit very slowly, at rates of a few centimeters per year. The boundaries where these plates interact are known as tectonic boundaries, and they are the sites of significant geological activity, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the creation of mountain ranges.\n\n\nThere are three main types of tectonic plate boundaries:\n\n\n1. Divergent boundaries: Plates move apart from each other, and new crust is created as magma rises from the mantle to fill the gap. This process is known as seafloor spreading and can lead to the formation of mid-ocean ridges.\n", "follow_all_instructions": false}

Do not use the word glucose.", "model_input": "Describe the process of photosynthesis in plants.", "response": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll, the green pigment, captures light energy.\n\n\nThe overall equation for photosynthesis can be simplified as:\n\n6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6 O2\n\n\nThis equation indicates that carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of light energy, are transformed into glucose and oxygen. The process involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).\n\n\n1. Light-dependent reactions: These occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and require light. When chlorophyll absorbs light energy, it becomes excited and transfers this energy through a series of proteins called the electron transport chain. This leads to the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nic", "follow_all_instructions": false}
