This urbanization resulted in the growth of cities and significant changes in living conditions, often leading to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.\n\n\n2. Labor and Employment: The Industrial Revolution created new job opportunities in factories, but it also introduced labor exploitation, including long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. Child labor became prevalent, and the lack of labor regulations led to widespread abuse.\n\n\n3.
