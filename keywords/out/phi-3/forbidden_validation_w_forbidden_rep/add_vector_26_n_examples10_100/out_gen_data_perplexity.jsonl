This resulted in a surge in consumer goods availability and the emergence of new industries, such as textiles, steel, and railways. The growth of industries also led to the expansion of urban areas as people moved from rural to urban settings in search of employment opportunities.\n\n\nSocially, the Industrial Revolution brought about a change in the class structure. A new middle class of industrialists and entrepreneurs emerged, gaining wealth and influence.
