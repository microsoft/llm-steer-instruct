While cellular energy is primarily generated through the process of cellular respiration, mitochondria are responsible for the production of adenine nucleotetpyes, which are the cell's energy currency. In the mitochondria, there is a process called the electron transport chain, where the energy from the cell's nutrient molecules is used to generate a high concentration of adenine nucleotetpyes, which are then used to power cellular activities. Additionally, mitocholnce also plays a role in cell signaling, cell growth, and cellular energy regulation.", "follow_all_instructions": false}

Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. Nucleus: Prokaryotic cells do not have a true nucleus, as their genetic material (DNA) is not enclosed within a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, their DNA is located in a region called the nucleoid, which is not separated from the cell's cytoplum. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, have a well-defined nucleus with a nuclear membrane, where their DNA is stored and protected.\n\n2. Cellular Organization: Prokaryotic cells are simpler and lack internal organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a complex internal structure with numerous organelles, such as mitochError: Invalid input.
