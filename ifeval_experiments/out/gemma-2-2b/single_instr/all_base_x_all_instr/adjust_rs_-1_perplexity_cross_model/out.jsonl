The film stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield as Saverin, and Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker. The film was released on October 1, 2010, by Columbia Pictures.\n\nThe film follows the creation of Facebook, from its inception in 2004 to its initial public offering in 2012. The film is told from the perspective of Zuckerberg, who is portrayed as a socially awkward and socially inept computer programmer who creates Facebook as a way to connect with his classmates at Harvard University. The film also follows the events that lead to the creation of the company, including the departure of Saverin and the hiring of Parker as its first president.\n\nThe film is a critical and commercial success, winning three Academy Awards for Best Original Score, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
