"Summarize the following paragraph.How to get to 100% renewable energy in the US? Two researchers from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley studied the potential for solar and wind energy to power the US grid. They concluded that it is possible to get to 100% renewable energy by 2050 by building more solar and wind farms. The authors also pointed out that such a system would be less vulnerable to disruptions than the current grid, which is reliant on a few large power plants. The authors' plan would also create jobs and reduce pollution."}
