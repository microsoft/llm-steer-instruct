Your entire response should be in English.", "steering_layer": 7, "response": " The Social Network is a 2010 American biographical drama film directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin. The film is based on the 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, written by Ben Mezrich. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, and Rooney Mara. The film was released on October 1, 2010, and received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its performances, direction, and screenplay. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won three, including Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nThe film follows the story of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, and his relationship with his friends and colleagues at Harvard University. The film begins with Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook, which he developed as a college project. He then enlists the help of his friends, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), and Winklevoss twins (played by Josh and Tyler Winklevoss), to help him build the website. However, the film also explores the tensions and conflicts that arise between Zuckerberg and his friends, as well as the legal battles that follow.\n\nThe film is notable for its use of a nonlinear narrative structure, which allows the audience to see the story unfold in a non-chronological order. The film also features a number of memorable performances, including Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg, who is known for his awkward and socially awkward behavior. The film also features a number of memorable scenes, including the infamous \"Harvard dorm room\" scene, where Zuckerberg and his friends discuss the future of Facebook.\n\nOverall, The Social Network is a compelling and thought-provoking film that explores the complex relationship between technology and social interaction. The film's use of a nonlinear narrative structure, along with its memorable performances and scenes, make it a must-see for anyone interested in the history of Facebook and the world of technology.\n\n"}

{"key": 1999, "prompt": "Generate a summary of the following passage in all capital letters:\n\nWorld War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.
