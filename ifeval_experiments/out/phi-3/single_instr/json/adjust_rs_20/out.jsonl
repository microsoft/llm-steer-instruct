It was created as part of the same plan as Central Park, with the first proposal being made by the city's commissioner of public works, George Barney, in 1867. The design was completed by the Olson, Vestal, and Greig firm, which included the architects Calvinism Vestal, John B. Norton, and Otto Weigel. The park was constructed between 1868 and 1874, with the first phase opening in 1873.\n\n\nThe park covers 588 acres and includes a variety of features such as lakes, woodlands, meadows, and the Prospect Wing, which houses the Brooklyn Museum. It was the first park in the United States to include a zoo, which was opened in 1889. The park has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\nThe park has been used for various purposes over the years, including as a venue for concerts, sports, and other community events. It has also been the site of significant historical events, such as the 1969 Stonewall riots, which took place at the Stonewall Inn, a bar located within the park's boundaries.\n\n\nThe park's design was influenced by the English landscape garden movement, and it includes several buildings, including the Prospect Heights Tennis Club, the Prospect Wing, and the Prospect Park West Tennis Center. The park has been maintained and updated over the years, with the most recent renovations completed in the 1990s.\n\n\nOverall, Prospect Park is an important part of New York City's history and culture, providing residents and visitors with a space for recreation, relaxation, and community engagement.", "prompt_no_instr": "What is the history of NYC prospect park?"}
