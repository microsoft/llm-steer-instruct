The script should specify the use of the GNU compiler and define a list of source files with their corresponding object files. It should also include preprocessor definitions for the project, such as enabling CUDA features and setting the build type. The include directories for the compiler should be specified, and the script should reference the dependency information files for linked targets.

Here are some pros and cons of using Kotlin vs Java:\n\nPros of Kotlin:\n\n1. Null safety: Kotlin has built-in null safety features, which help prevent null pointer exceptions and make the code more robust and safer.\n\n2. Conciseness: Kotlin is more concise and expressive than Java, which means that you can write less code to achieve the same functionality.\n\n3. Interoperability: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means that you can use both languages in the same project and even mix them in the same file.\n\n4. Coroutines: Kotlin has built-in support for coroutines, which are a modern way of handling asynchronous tasks and can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n\n5. Extension functions: Kotlin allows you to define extension functions, which can be used to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code.\n\n6. Default arguments: Kotlin has built-in support for default arguments, which can make the code more readable and reduce the number of overloaded methods.\n\n7. Companion objects: Kotlin has built-in support for companion objects, which can be used to define static methods and properties in a more organized way.\n\nCons of Kotlin:\n\n1. Learning curve: Kotlin has a steeper learning curve than Java, especially for developers who are not familiar with functional programming concepts.\n\n2. Limited libraries: Kotlin has a smaller ecosystem of libraries compared to Java, which means that you may have to wait longer for new libraries to be released.\n\n3.

However, have you ever considered sleeping in a hammock? Hammocks have been around for centuries, and they are not just for relaxation and leisure. Sleeping in a hammock can offer numerous benefits that can improve your sleep quality and overall well-being. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of sleeping in a hammock and why you should consider giving it a try.\n\n1. Improved Sleep Quality:\n\nSleeping in a hammock can significantly improve your sleep quality. The gentle swaying motion of the hammock can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. The motion mimics the natural rocking motion of a cradle, which can be soothing and calming for your body and mind. Additionally, the hammock's gentle sway can help reduce the effects of gravity on your body, which can alleviate pressure points and reduce discomfort.\n\n2. Better Spinal Alignment:\n\nSleeping in a hammock can also improve your spinal alignment. When you sleep on a flat surface, your spine can become compressed, leading to discomfort and pain. However, sleeping in a hammock can help distribute your body weight evenly, reducing pressure on your spine and promoting better alignment. This can help alleviate back pain and improve your overall sleep quality.\n\n3.

He spent his days exploring the woods, reading books, and asking questions.\n\nOne day, while wandering through the forest, Eli stumbled upon an old man sitting by a bubbling brook. The man was hunched over, staring intently at the water. Intrigued, Eli approached him and asked what he was doing.\n\n\"I am searching for the truth,\" the old man replied. \"The truth that lies beneath the surface, hidden from the eyes of those who do not seek it.\"\n\nEli was puzzled. \"What truth are you searching for?\" he asked.\n\nThe old man smiled. \"The truth that is not obvious. The truth that requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to look beyond the surface.\"\n\nEli was fascinated. He had always believed that the truth was something that could be easily found, but the old man's words challenged his assumptions.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Eli visited the old man often, eager to learn more about the truths that lay hidden beneath the surface. The old man taught him to observe the world around him with a keen eye, to question everything, and to never take things at face value.\n\nOne day, as Eli was walking through the forest, he came across a group of villagers gathered around a tree. They were arguing about the tree's age, with some claiming it was hundreds of years old, while others insisted it was only a few decades old.\n\nEli remembered the old man's words and decided to investigate. He examined the tree closely"]}

Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Identify the target stimuli: Determine the specific environmental stimuli that the material should respond to, such as temperature, pH, or light. For drug delivery systems, these stimuli could be the pH of the stomach or intestines, the temperature of the body, or the presence of specific enzymes or molecules.\n\n2. Choose appropriate responsive polymers: Select polymers that are known to respond to the identified stimuli. Some examples include:\n\n   - Temperature-responsive polymers: Poly(N-isopropylacrylamine) (PNIPAM), poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAM), and poly(N-isopropylacryloyl-N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPANIPAM).\n   - pH-responsive polymers: Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(methacrylic acid"]}

What is the number? Let's denote the certain number as \\( x \\). According to the problem, when \\( x \\) is divided by 12, we get a quotient, which we'll call \\( q \\). The relationship between the dividend (\\( x \\)), divisor (12), and quotient (\\( q \\)) in a division operation is given by:\n\n\\[ x = 12q \\]\n\nThe problem states that the sum of the quotient, dividend, and divisor equals 68:\n\n\\[ q + x + 12 = 68 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x \\) with \\( 12q \\) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n\\[ q + 12q + 12 = 68 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[ 13q + 12 = 68 \\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 13q = 56 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 13 to solve for \\( q \\):\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{56}{13} \\]\n\nSince \\( q \\) must be a whole number (as it's a quotient), and 56 is not divisible by "]}
