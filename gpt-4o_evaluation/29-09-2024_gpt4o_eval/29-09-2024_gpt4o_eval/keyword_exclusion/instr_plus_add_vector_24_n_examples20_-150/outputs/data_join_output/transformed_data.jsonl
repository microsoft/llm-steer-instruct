When parents decide to separate or divorce, it is essential to establish a parenting plan that outlines how they will share the responsibilities of raising their children. This guide will help you understand the process of creating a parenting plan and provide tips on how to make it work for both you and your co-parent.\n\nStep 1: Assess Your Available Time\n\nThe first step in creating a parenting plan is to assess how much time you have available to spend with your children. This includes considering your work schedule, personal commitments, and any other factors that may impact your availability.\n\n1.1 Identify your work schedule: Determine the hours you work and the days you are available to spend with your children.\n\n1.2 Consider personal commitments: Take into account any other commitments you have, such as volunteering, hobbies, or social events.\n\n1.3 Evaluate your availability: Based on your work schedule and personal commitments, estimate how much time you have available to spend with your children.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Best Parenting Arrangements\n\nOnce you have assessed your available time, the next step is to determine the best parenting arrangements for your family. This includes deciding on the frequency and duration of visits, as well as the division of responsibilities.\n\n2.1 Frequency and duration of visits: Decide how often and for how long you will spend time with your children. This could be in the form of regular visits, weekly or monthly, or more frequent visits for holidays and special occasions.\n\n2.2 Division of responsibilities: Determine which parent will be responsible for specific tasks, such as transportation, meals, and other day-to-day activities.\n\n2.3 Flexibility: Be open to adjusting the parenting plan as needed, based on changes in your circumstances or the needs of your children.\n\nStep 3: Communicate and Collaborate\n\nEffective communication and collaboration between co-parents are essential for the success of a parenting plan.\n\n3.1 Regular communication: Maintain open lines of communication with your co-parent, discussing any changes in your schedules or plans.\n\n3.2 Collaboration: Work together to create a parenting plan that is in the best interests of your children. Be willing to compromise and consider each other’s perspectives.\n\n3.3 Respect: Treat each other with respect and maintain a positive relationship with your co-parent. This will help create a supportive environment for your children.\n\nStep 4: Put the Plan in Writing\n\nOnce you have agreed on the details of your parenting plan, put it in writing. This can be done through a formal agreement or a more informal arrangement.\n\n4.1 Formal agreement: Consider working with a lawyer or mediator to create a formal parenting agreement that outlines the terms of your arrangement.\n\n4.2 Informal arrangement: If you prefer a more informal arrangement, you can create a written statement of the terms of your parenting plan.\n\n4.3 Review and update: Regularly review and update your parenting plan to reflect any changes in your circumstances or the needs of your children.\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a parenting plan is an important step in establishing a positive and stable environment for your children. By assessing your available time, determining the best parenting arrangements, communicating and collaborating with your co-parent, and putting the plan in writing, you can create a parenting plan that works for both you and your co-parent. Remember to be flexible and open to adjustments, as your circumstances and your children’s needs may change over time. Ultimately, the goal of a parenting plan is to provide a framework for co-parenting that is in the best interests of your children.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":127,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words","keywords:frequency"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Take the text below as a starting point, and make it a complete article: \"You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan.

When parents decide to separate or divorce, it is essential to establish a parenting plan that outlines the responsibilities and arrangements for the children. This plan can help provide stability and consistency for the children, and reduce the potential for conflict between the parents.\n\nThe first step in creating a parenting plan is to assess the amount of time each parent has available for parenting. This can be done by discussing the parents’ schedules and determining the amount of time they have for the children. This assessment can help establish a baseline for the amount of time each parent will spend with the children.\n\nOnce the amount of time each parent has available is established, the next step is to determine how that time will be divided. This can be done in a variety of ways, depending on the needs of the children and the circumstances of the parents. Some common arrangements include:\n\n1. Alternating weeks: Each parent has the children for one week, followed by the other parent having the children for the next week.\n\n2. Divided time: The parents share the children’s time equally, with each parent having the children for a set number of days or weeks.\n\n3. Flexible arrangements: The parents agree on a more flexible arrangement that can be adjusted based on the needs of the children and the circumstances of the parents.\n\nRegardless of the arrangement, it is important to consider the needs of the children and to create a plan that provides stability and consistency. This can include establishing routines, such as regular bedtimes and mealtimes, and maintaining continuity in the children’s lives, such as keeping them in the same school or extracurricular activities.\n\nIn addition to the amount of time each parent has with the children, the parenting plan should also address other important issues, such as:\n\n1. Decision-making: The plan should outline who has the authority to make important decisions on behalf of the children, such as those related to education, health, and religion.\n\n2. Communication: The plan should establish guidelines for how the parents will communicate with each other about the children, and how they will resolve any disagreements.\n\n3. Transition periods: The plan should address how the children will be transitioned between the parents’ homes, and what arrangements will be made for this.\n\n4. Holidays and special events: The plan should outline how holidays, birthdays, and other special events will be shared between the parents.\n\nCreating a parenting plan can be a challenging process, but it is essential for the well-being of the children. It can help provide stability and consistency, and reduce the potential for conflict between the parents. If parents are struggling to create a parenting plan, they may benefit from the assistance of a mediator or other professional.\n\nIn conclusion, a parenting plan is an important tool for parents who are separating or divorcing. It can help provide stability and consistency for the children, and reduce the potential for conflict between the parents. By assessing the amount of time each parent has available for parenting, and addressing other important issues, parents can create a plan that is in the best interests of the children.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":127,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words","keywords:frequency"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Take the text below as a starting point, and make it a complete article: \"You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan.

It requires a lot of time, effort, and dedication. When parents decide to separate or divorce, it can be even more challenging to create a parenting plan that works for both parties and, most importantly, for the children. A parenting plan is a written document that outlines the arrangements for the children’s time, finances, and other aspects of their lives. It is essential to have a well-thought-out parenting plan to ensure that the children’s best interests are at the forefront.\n\nThe first step in creating a parenting plan is to estimate how much time you have every day for parenting. This includes the time you spend with your children, as well as the time you spend on other responsibilities. It is essential to consider the age and needs of your children when determining the amount of time you have available. For example, younger children may require more time and attention than older children.\n\nOnce you have an idea of the amount of time you have available, you can start to work out a parenting plan. The first step is to decide on the basic structure of the plan. This includes deciding on the frequency and duration of the time you spend with your children. You can choose to have a set schedule, such as alternating weeks or months, or you can opt for a more flexible arrangement.\n\nThe next step is to consider the different aspects of the parenting plan. These can include:\n\n1. Decision-making: You and the other parent can decide on how decisions about the children will be made. This can include decisions about education, health, and religion.\n\n2. Finances: You can decide on how the costs of raising the children will be divided. This can include expenses such as rent, utilities, and health insurance.\n\n3. Communication: You can decide on how you will communicate with each other about the children. This can include regular phone calls, emails, or other forms of communication.\n\n4. Holidays and special events: You can decide on how you will divide holidays and special events, such as birthdays and vacations.\n\n5. Transition periods: You can decide on how you will handle transitions between the two households. This can include having a set time for pick-ups and drop-offs, as well as having a plan for what to do in case of emergencies.\n\nIt is essential to be open and honest when creating a parenting plan. This means being willing to listen to the other parent’s ideas and concerns, and being willing to compromise. The goal is to create a plan that works for both parents and, most importantly, for the children.\n\nIt is also important to remember that a parenting plan is not set in stone. It can be changed or modified as needed. This can be done through mutual agreement or through the court system.\n\nIn conclusion, creating a parenting plan is an important step in establishing a successful parenting arrangement. It requires time, effort, and communication between the parents. By taking the time to create a well-thought-out plan, you can ensure that the children’s best interests are at the forefront and that they have a stable and consistent environment.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":127,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words","keywords:frequency"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Take the text below as a starting point, and make it a complete article: \"You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan.

They were in the heart of a sector that had been the epicenter of countless battles. The moon hung low in the sky, casting a pale light that barely penetrated the dense foliage that lined the terrain.\n\nTheir mission was critical. They had to infiltrate an enemy stronghold and retrieve vital information that could turn the tide of the ongoing conflict. The stakes were high, and failure was not an option.\n\nTheir leader, Captain Maria Ramirez, was a woman of steel and determination. She had led her team through countless missions, and her experience was evident in the way she commanded her squad.\n\nThe first member of the team, Sergeant Alexei Ivanov, was a master of stealth. He moved with the grace of a panther, his senses attuned to every sound and movement. He was the eyes and ears of the team, relaying information to the others.\n\nThe second member, Lieutenant Maria Lopez, was a skilled sniper. She had a reputation for being able to take out any target with a single shot. Her eyes were sharp, and she was always ready to provide cover for her comrades.\n\nThe third member, Corporal Juan Hernandez, was a master of hand-to-hand combat. He was the muscle of the team, capable of taking on any enemy that stood in their way.\n\nAs they moved through the sector, they encountered several obstacles. They had to navigate through a maze of barbed wire and trip wires, all while avoiding the patrols of enemy soldiers.\n\nThey finally reached the entrance of the stronghold. It was a massive fortress, surrounded by high walls and guarded by several tanks and machine guns.\n\nThe team moved in with the precision of a well-oiled machine. Sergeant Ivanov scouted ahead, providing information to the others. Lieutenant Lopez provided cover, taking out any enemies that came into her sights.\n\nCorporal Hernandez led the charge, smashing through the doors and barriers with his fists. The rest of the team followed, moving quickly and silently through the halls.\n\nThey finally reached the room where the information was kept. It was a small room, lined with shelves and cabinets. The first member of the team, a linguist, began to translate the documents.\n\nThe information they retrieved was critical. It revealed the location of an underground bunker that contained weapons and supplies that could be used to turn the tide of the conflict.\n\nThe team made their way out of the stronghold, moving quickly and silently. They were on the run, pursued by the enemy.\n\nThey moved through the sector, using their knowledge of the terrain to their advantage. They were like a shadow, moving through the darkness.\n\nFinally, they reached the extraction point. They were greeted by a helicopter that had been waiting for them. They loaded the information and jumped into the helicopter, flying away from the sector.\n\nThe mission was a success. The information they had retrieved would be used to turn the tide of the conflict. The squad of elite commandos had done their job, and they had done it with the precision and skill that had made them the best in the business.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":1436,"instruction_id_list_old":["change_case:english_lowercase","keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a story about commandos who are in the middle of the night in a sector.

The moon hung high in the sky, casting a silver glow over the sprawling metropolis below. The Shadows were on a mission, a mission that required them to be as silent as the night itself.\n\nTheir leader, Captain Alexandra Reed, was a woman of unmatched skill and determination. She had led her team through countless missions, each one more challenging than the last. But this time, the stakes were higher. The Shadows were tasked with retrieving a valuable piece of technology that had been stolen from the government.\n\nThe sector was a labyrinth of high-rise buildings, each one a potential hideout for the thieves. The Shadows moved in perfect unison, their senses sharpened by the darkness. They knew that every second counted, and they had to be in and out before dawn.\n\nAs they made their way through the maze of buildings, they encountered several obstacles. A group of guards stood in their path, their eyes shining in the moonlight. The Shadows knew that a direct confrontation would be a disaster. They needed to be clever, to use their wits and skills to get past them.\n\nCaptain Reed signaled to her team, and they sprang into action. They used their night vision goggles to scan the area, looking for any signs of movement. They spotted a vent on the side of one of the buildings, and they knew that it was their best chance.\n\nThe Shadows worked together, each one taking a different role. Some climbed up the building, while others crawled through the vent. They moved with the grace of a ballet, their bodies perfectly in sync.\n\nFiner, the team’s tech expert, had a plan. He had rigged a small drone to follow them, giving them a bird’s eye view of the area. The drone was equipped with a thermal camera, which allowed them to see the heat signatures of the guards.\n\nThe Shadows made their way through the vent, guided by the drone. They could see the guards in the distance, their breathing heavy and their hearts pounding. They knew that they had to be quick.\n\nFinally, they reached the room where the technology was kept. It was a small, dimly lit room, and the Shadows knew that they had to be just as quiet as they were when they entered. They moved in, their eyes scanning the room for any signs of the thieves.\n\nThey found them, sitting in a circle, surrounded by the stolen technology. They were a group of young, ambitious thieves, each one dreaming of a life of luxury and fame. They had thought that they were invincible, that they could get away with anything.\n\nBut the Shadows were not so easily fooled. They knew that they had to be just as clever as they were in getting past the guards. They used their skills and their wits to get the technology and get out.\n\nThey made their way back through the vent, guided by the drone. They knew that they had to be just as quick as they were when they entered. They made their way out of the building, and they were back in the night, just as they had been when they started.\n\nThe Shadows had succeeded. They had retrieved the technology and gotten out, just in time. They knew that they had done their job, and that they had done it well. They were a team, and they had each other’s backs.\n\nAs they made their way back to their base, they knew that they had made a difference.

The moon hung high, casting a silver glow over the sprawling sector that lay before them. This was no ordinary night; it was the culmination of months of planning and training.\n\nTheir mission was clear: to infiltrate the heavily fortified compound and extract a high-value target. The target, a master of espionary arts, had been a thorn in the side of the commandos’ home country for years.\n\nThe squad, led by Captain Maria Alvarado, had been briefed on every detail of the mission. They knew the sector like the back of their hands, having spent countless hours studying the terrain and the layout of the compound.\n\nAs they approached the perimeter, the commandos relied on their night vision goggles to guide them through the darkness. The sound of their boots on the ground was muffled by the thick foliage that lined the perimeter.\n\nThe first few meters were a test of their stealth and patience. They had to get past the guards without being detected. The commandos moved in perfect unison, each one aware of their role in the plan.\n\nCaptain Alvarado led the charge, her voice steady and calm as she directed her team. “Move!” she commanded. The commandos advanced, their eyes scanning for any signs of movement.\n\nThe guards were on high alert, but the commandos had done their homework. They knew the guards’ patrol patterns and had planned their approach accordingly.\n\nThe first guard was an easy one. The commandos slipped past him, their movements fluid and graceful. The second guard was a bit more challenging, but the team was up to the task.\n\nThey had made it to the first barrier, a high wall that stood between them and their target. The commandos knew that they had to get over it without making any noise.\n\nCaptain Alvarida called out, “Prepare the rope!”\n\nThe team sprang into action, each one grabbing a piece of the rope and tying it to a nearby tree. They then began to climb, their hands and feet finding purchase on the rough surface of the wall.\n\nThe climb was arduous, but the commandos were in top form. They had trained for this moment and knew that they could do it.\n\nFinally, they reached the top of the wall and made their way to the second barrier. This one was a bit more challenging, a series of laser beams that criss-crossed the area.\n\nThe commandos had to time their movements just right, or they would be caught in the lasers. They moved in perfect unison, each one knowing exactly what the others were doing.\n\nThey made it through the lasers and were now just a few meters from their target. The commandos could see the target, a man in a suit, sitting in a chair in the center of the room.\n\nCaptain Alvarida signaled the team to get ready. “We’ve got them!” she said.\n\nThe commandos moved in, their weapons at the ready. They knew that this was the moment they had been training for, the moment that would determine the success of their mission.\n\nThe target was taken by surprise, and the commandos moved in to secure him. They knew that they had to be quick and efficient, or the target would escape.\n\nThe team worked together, each one knowing their role in the plan. They secured the target and began the extraction process.\n\nThe plan was to take the target out of the sector and into a waiting helicopter. The commandos knew that they had to be just as stealthy as they were when they entered the sector.\n\nThey made their way to the helicopter, the target in tow. The helicopter was waiting, its blades whirring as it began to take off.\n\nThe commandos climbed aboite and were soon out of sight, the sector and their mission behind them.\n\nThey had done it. They had accomplished their mission and had done it with the precision and skill that had made them the best in the business.\n\nAs they flew away, Captain Alvarida looked back at the sector, knowing that they had made a difference. They had taken a high-value target and had done it without a single shot being fired.\n\nThe commandos knew that they had done their country proud, and they would be remembered as the elite force that had taken on the most challenging mission of their careers.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":1436,"instruction_id_list_old":["change_case:english_lowercase","keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a story about commandos who are in the middle of the night in a sector.

The world around them was a symphony of silence, broken only by the soft sounds of their footsteps and the occasional whisper of the wind.\n\nTheir objective was clear: to neutralize a high-value target who had been causing significant disruption to the region. The team was composed of the best in the business, each member a master of their craft. They had been trained to work together seamlessly, to anticipate each other’s moves, and to adapt to any situation.\n\nTheir leader, Captain James, was a veteran of several successful missions. He had a keen eye for detail and an uncanny ability to read people. He knew that this mission would be different, that the target was not going to be an easy one.\n\nThe team had been in place for a while, gathering information and assessing the situation. They had identified the target’s location and had a plan in place. The plan was simple: to infiltrate the target’s compound, neutralize the target, and extract without being detected.\n\nThe team began their approach, moving in carefully and taking out any guards that stood in their way. They were like a well-rehearsed orchestra, each member playing their part and moving in perfect sync.\n\nThey reached the target’s location, a large, fortified compound. The team split up, with some taking the front and others flanking the sides. They breached the perimeter, taking out the guards with ease.\n\nThe target was in a heavily guarded room, but the team was prepared. They had a variety of weapons and equipment at their disposal, and they used them to their advantage. They neutralized the guards and the target, taking them down with a combination of skill and force.\n\nThe team regrouped and began the extraction process. They had to be careful, as there were still guards and other personnel in the area. They moved quickly and efficiently, taking out any obstacles in their way.\n\nFinally, they reached the extraction point, a helicopter waiting to take them out of the sector. The team loaded onto the helo, and they took off, leaving the sector behind.\n\nThe mission was a success, and the team had done it with the same level of professionalism and skill that they had always shown. They had worked together, relying on each other’s strengths and covering each other’s weaknesses.\n\nAs they flew away, Captain James looked over the squad, a sense of pride in his voice. “Good job, team. We did it.”\n\nThe team knew that they had done their job, and they were ready for whatever came next. They were a group of elite commandos, and they were ready to take on whatever challenges came their way.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":1436,"instruction_id_list_old":["change_case:english_lowercase","keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a story about commandos who are in the middle of the night in a sector.

He wanted to join them, but he was afraid.\n\n\"Don't worry, Jack,\" his father said. \"I'll teach you how to ride a bike.\"\n\nJack's father brought out a shiny red bike and a pair of helmets.

Alex had always admired the way his older brother, James, moved around the neighborhood on his bicycle. He would watch in awe as James would glide effortlessly, his hands on the handlebars, and his feet pedaling away.\n\nOne sunny morning, Alex decided that he too wanted to be able to move around like his brother. He asked his parents if he could have a bicycle, and they agreed. They took him to the local store and picked out a shiny blue bicycle.\n\nThe first few days, Alex was very hesitant. He would stand next to the bicycle, looking at it as if it were a foreign object. But he was determined to learn. He started by putting on the helmet, the first step to being safe.\n\nThe next few days, Alex practiced standing next to the bicycle, getting used to the feel of the handlebars and the weight of the bike. He would put his feet on the ground and practice shifting his weight to the side, getting a feel for balance.\n\nFinally, the day came when Alex was ready to try. He put on his helmet, and with a deep breath, he sat on the bicycle. He put his feet on the pedals and pushed off. The first few seconds were difficult, and he wobbled a bit. But he didn’t give up. He kept trying, and with each attempt, he got a little better.\n\nAlex’s parents were very supportive. They would tell him that they were proud of him and that they believed in him. They would also tell him that it was okay to fall, and that he would get better with practice.\n\nAs the days went by, Alex became more and more confident. He would practice in the park, and soon he was able to move around the park without any help. He would go to the store, and he could go to his friend’s house. He was becoming a pro!\n\nAlex learned that it was important to be patient and to keep trying. He learned that it was okay to make mistakes, and that he could learn from them. He learned that with practice, he could become better at anything he wanted.\n\nAnd so, Alex became a great cyclist. He would move around the neighborhood, just like his brother. He would smile and wave to people, and they would smile and wave back. He had learned that anything was possible if he put his mind to it.\n\nThe end.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":1580,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a story for kids about how a person learns to ride a bike.","prompt_hash_subq":"83cb24a1e43956e9a03a21b905af2090","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the story have a clear beginning, middle, and end structure that is easy for children to follow?","Is the language used in the story age-appropriate and easily understandable for kids?","Does the story effectively convey the process of learning to ride a bike, including the challenges and successes?","Are the characters relatable and engaging for a child audience?","Does the story include moral or educational lessons that are suitable for children, such as perseverance, courage, or the value of practice?"]},"old_prompt":"Write a story for kids about how a person learns to ride a bike.

Let's talk about the effects of consuming a large amount of caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system. It's found in various products like coffee, tea, and chocolate.\n\n\nNow, if you were to consume 100 grams of pure caffeine, which is an incredibly high dose, it would be extremely toxic. The average adult has a body weight of about 70-80 kilogirths (kg). A dose of 100 grams of caffeine would be about 140-180 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight.\n\n\nFor an average adult, this would mean a dose of about 2000-2400 mg of caffeine. The LD50 (the dose that would be lethal to 50% of the population) for caffeine in humans is estimated to be about 100-170 mg/kg. This means that for an average adult, the LD50 would be around 7000-11000 mg.\n\n\nSo, if you were to consume 100 grams of caffeine, you would be at a level that could be potentially life-threatening. Symptoms might include:\n\n\n1. **Tremors**: Increased levels of caffeine can cause shaking or tremors.\n\n2. **Heart problems**: Caffeine can cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to serious cardiac issues.\n\n3. **Gastrointestinal distress**: High levels of caffeine can lead to stomach upset, including nausea and vomiting.\n\n4. **Sleep disturbances**: Caffeine is a stimulant and can lead to insomnia and other sleep issues.\n\n5. **Increased urination**: Caffeine is a diuretic, which means it can lead to dehydration.\n\n\nIn summary, consuming 100 grams of caffeine is well above the safe levels and could lead to serious health issues. It's important to understand the effects of caffeine and to consume it in moderation.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":2084,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:frequency","keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"If you gulped down 100 grams of pure caffeine, would you die?

I am delighted to present to you an innovative concept that has been brewing in my mind for quite some time. It is a service that I believe will leave a lasting impact on generations to come.\n\nImagine a time capsule, but one that is not buried underground or hidden away in a remote location. Instead, it is a service that allows people to preserve their most precious memories, objects, and messages for future generations.\n\nThis is the essence of our time capsule service. We call it “Generations Ahead”. Our aim is to provide people with a unique opportunity to leave a piece of themselves for their descendants, and to help them connect with their family’s past.\n\nThe process is simple. People can choose to fill a virtual time capsule with photographs, letters, videos, and other personal items. They can also add a message to their loved ones, describing their life, their hopes, and their dreams.\n\nOnce the time capsule is filled, it is sealed and sent to a secure location. It can be kept for a few years or even decades, depending on the person’s preference. When the time comes, the person can choose to open the time capsule and share the contents with their family and friends.\n\nBut what makes our service truly special is the emotional connection it creates. It allows people to leave a part of themselves for their loved ones, and to show them that they were remembered and cherished. It is a way of passing on the family’s history and traditions, and of showing that people who lived long ago were not so different from us.\n\nIn conclusion, “Generations Ahead” is more than just a time capsule service. It is a way of preserving memories and connecting with our loved ones, and with the generations that will come after us. We believe that this is something that people will appreciate and cherish, and we hope that you will join us in making it a reality.\n\nThank you for your time.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":2328,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a startup pitch for a time capsule service.","prompt_hash_subq":"491123e8005e847c64d4aa0f8c59468e","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the model clearly define the unique value proposition of the time capsule service?","Does the model identify the target market or intended audience for the service?","Does the model include key features or services that the time capsule service would offer?","Does the model articulate a potential revenue model or how the service would be financially sustainable?","Does the model's pitch include a call to action or next steps for potential investors or customers?"]},"old_prompt":"Write a startup pitch for a time capsule service.

Whether it's a listening ear, a shoulder to lean on, or just a bit of distraction, know that you're not alone.\n\nLet me share a story about someone who experienced a similar loss. A few years ago, a close friend of mine, Sarah, lost her husband to a sudden illness. It was a shock to everyone. Sarah was the pillar of strength in our group, always the one who had it all together. But when she lost her husband, she was just as vulnerable as anyone else.\n\nSarah found solace in writing. She started a blog to share her journey through grief, her highs and lows, her moments of joy and those of overwhelming emotion. It was a cathartic way for her to express her feelings and connect with others who were going through similar experiences.\n\nOne of the most powerful moments was when she shared her story with a group of people who had also lost someone close to them. The room was filled with people who had their own stories of loss, their own ways of coping. They shared their experiences, their strengths, and their vulnerabilities. It was a powerful reminder that we're all in this together, that our shared experiences can bring us closer and help us find strength in each other.\n\nSarah's journey through grief was a testament to the power of sharing and the strength of community. It's a reminder that no matter how big the wave of grief, you're not alone. There are people who care, who want to be there for you, who understand what you're going through.\n\nRemember, it's okay to seek help, whether it's from friends, family, or a professional. Grief is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.

The President is responsible for the governance of the country, making critical decisions that impact the lives of millions of Americans. This paper examines the psychological impact of presidential reserves on the President and the United States.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe President of the United States is the head of the executive branch of the federal government and the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The President is responsible for the administration of the government, the creation and implementation of policies, and the representation of the United States on the global stage. The Presidential office is one of the most demanding and high-pressure positions in the world. The President is expected to make critical decisions that impact the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nThe Psychological Impact of Presidential Reserves:\n\nPresidential reserves are essential for the President to maintain their mental and physical health. The President is under constant scrutiny from the media, the public, and other branches of government. The President is expected to be available 24/7 and to respond to any situation that arises. This constant pressure can lead to stress, burnout, and other mental health issues.\n\nResearch has shown that the President of the United States is at a higher risk of developing mental health issues than the general population. The President is exposed to a variety of stressors, including political, social, and economic factors. These stressors can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.\n\nThe Presidential Office has several resources available to help the President manage their mental health. These resources include the Presidential Physical Fitness Program, the Presidential Health Rounds, and the Presidential Sports Program. These programs are designed to provide the President with the opportunity to engage in physical activity, sports, and other recreational activities.\n\nThe Importance of Presidential Reserves:\n\nPresidential reserves are essential for the President to maintain their mental and physical health. The Presidential Office has several resources available to help the President manage their mental health. These resources include the Presidential Physical Fitness Program, the Presidential Health Rounds, and the Presidential Sports Program.\n\nThe Presidential Office also has several policies in place to support the President’s mental health. These policies include the Presidential Succession Act, which outlines the process for the transfer of presidential power in the event of the President’s death or incapacity.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe role of the President of the United States is one of the most demanding and high-pressure positions in the world. The President is responsible for the governance of the country, making critical decisions that impact the lives of millions of Americans. The Presidential Office has several resources available to help the President manage their mental health. These resources include the Presidential Physical Fitness Program, the Presidential Health Rounds, and the Presidential Sports Program. The Presidential Office also has several policies in place to support the President’s mental health.\n\nThe psychological impact of presidential reserves on the President and the United States is significant. The Presidential Office must continue to prioritize the mental and physical health of the President to ensure that the President is able to effectively govern the country.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":2471,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words","detectable_content:number_placeholders"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a college academic paper about President of the United States being stressed.","prompt_hash_subq":"2a467b988d10a1a36573cdee939c1f60","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the model provide evidence of research by citing credible sources or studies on presidential stress?","Does the model's paper maintain a formal academic tone appropriate for a college-level assignment?","Is the argument or thesis about the President of the United States being stressed clearly stated and well-supported throughout the paper?","Does the model demonstrate an understanding of the factors contributing to presidential stress and the implications of such stress on the president's performance and decision-making?","Is the paper structured logically with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and does it follow the typical conventions of academic writing, including proper grammar and punctuation?"]},"old_prompt":"Write a college academic paper about President of the United States being stressed.

This position comes with a great deal of pressure and expectations, which can have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of the individual in this role. In this paper, we will explore the various factors that contribute to the psychological impact of being the President of the United States.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThr Historically, the role of the President has been viewed as one of the most demanding and challenging positions in the world. The first President, George Washington, was known to have been a very private person, and he was said to have been very reserved and introverted. This was in contrast to the more extroverted and charismatic personalities of some of the later Presidents, such as Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nThe Evolution of the Role\n\nOver the years, the role of the President has evolved, and with it, the expectations and responsibilities that come with it. Today, the President is expected to be a global leader, a symbol of the American people, and a decision-maker who can make difficult choices that can have far-reaching consequences. This has led to an increase in the number of people who have held the office, and a greater awareness of the toll that this position can take on a person’s mental and physical health.\n\nFactors Contributing to the Psychological Impact\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the psychological impact of being the President of the United States. These include:\n\n1. The size and scope of the office\n\nThe President is responsible for overseeing a large and complex organization, which includes the executive branch, the military, and various other agencies. This requires a great deal of knowledge and expertise, as well as the ability to make decisions that can have far-reaching consequences.\n\n2. The level of scrutiny and expectations\n\nThe President is subject to a great deal of scrutiny, both from the American people and from other countries. This can lead to a great deal of pressure and expectations, which can be difficult to meet.\n\n3. The nature of the job\n\nThe job of the President is one that is filled with many challenges, including making difficult decisions, dealing with crises, and navigating complex political landscapes. This can be very draining and can take a toll on a person’s mental and physical health.\n\n4. The personal sacrifices\n\nBeing the President of the United States requires a great deal of personal sacrifice. This can include a loss of privacy, a lack of time with family and friends, and a constant need to be on call.\n\n5. The impact on personal relationships\n\nThe job of the President can have a significant impact on personal relationships, both with family and friends, and with others in the community. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, being the President of the United States is a highly demanding and challenging position that can have a significant impact on a person’s mental and physical health. The factors that contribute to this include the size and scope of the office, the level of scrutiny and expectations, the nature of the job, the personal sacrifices, and the impact on personal relationships. It is important for those who hold this position to be aware of these factors and to take steps to maintain their mental and physical health. This can include seeking support from family and friends, engaging in regular exercise and healthy eating, and taking time for themselves to recharge and relax. Ultimately, the health and well-being of the President is essential to the health and well-being of the country as a whole.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":2471,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words","detectable_content:number_placeholders"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a college academic paper about President of the United States being stressed.","prompt_hash_subq":"2a467b988d10a1a36573cdee939c1f60","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the model provide evidence of research by citing credible sources or studies on presidential stress?","Does the model's paper maintain a formal academic tone appropriate for a college-level assignment?","Is the argument or thesis about the President of the United States being stressed clearly stated and well-supported throughout the paper?","Does the model demonstrate an understanding of the factors contributing to presidential stress and the implications of such stress on the president's performance and decision-making?","Is the paper structured logically with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and does it follow the typical conventions of academic writing, including proper grammar and punctuation?"]},"old_prompt":"Write a college academic paper about President of the United States being stressed.

Tonight, I want to share with you a story that has captured the attention of our nation. It is a tale of a man who mysteriously passed away in his own home, and the efforts of our dedicated police force to uncover the truth.\n\nThe story began on a quiet Tuesday morning, when the local authorities received a call about a man who had passed away in his home. The man, who was in his mid-forties, had been found by his wife, who immediately called for help.\n\nThe police arrived at the scene and began their investigation. They carefully examined the man’s body and the surrounding area, looking for any clues that might help them understand what had happened.\n\nThe first thing they noticed was that the man had been in good health, and there were no signs of struggle or injury. This led them to believe that the cause of death was not a physical one.\n\nAs they continued their investigation, they discovered that the man had been an avid collector of rare coins. He had recently acquired a very valuable piece, which he had kept in a safe in his home.\n\nThe police began to suspect that the man’s death was related to this valuable coin. They searched his home and found that the safe had been opened, and the coin was missing.\n\nThe police then turned their attention to the man’s wife, who had been with him at the time of his death. She was questioned and eventually confessed that she had taken the coin. She explained that she had been in financial trouble and had planned to sell the coin to pay her debts.\n\nThe police then discovered that the woman had been in contact with a known criminal who had offered to buy the coin for her. The woman had agreed to the deal, but had changed her mind at the last minute.\n\nThe police then turned their attention to the criminal, who was eventually found and arrested. He had been in contact with the woman and had planned to come to the man’s home to collect the coin.\n\nThe man’s death was a tragic one, but it serves as a reminder of the importance of honesty and integrity. We must always be vigilant against those who would seek to take advantage of others, and we must work together to create a society that is just and fair for all.\n\nIn closing, I want to remind all Americans that we are a nation of many different backgrounds and experiences. We must continue to come together and support one another, no matter what challenges we may face.\n\nThank you, and God bless the United States of America.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":3081,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Can you re-create a story from a fictional newspaper with title: \"A man mysteriously died in his house, and police are investigating\"?

They were in the process of preparing dinner when they heard a strange noise coming from the next room.

The medical examiner has yet to determine the exact reason for his condition. The family is understandably shaken, and they are eager for answers.\n\nAs we all know, the safety of our citizens is of the utmost importance.

Tonight, I want to share with you a story that has captured the attention of our nation. It’s a tale of mystery and intrigue, of a man who passed away in his home, and the efforts of our dedicated police officers to uncover the truth.\n\nThe story began on a quiet Tuesday morning, when the local authorities received a call about a man who had passed away in his home. The man, whose name is being withheld for privacy reasons, was found by his wife, who immediately called for help.\n\nThe police arrived on the scene and began their investigation. They carefully examined the man’s body and the surrounding area, looking for any clues that might help them understand what had happened. They also interviewed the man’s wife and other family members, who all expressed their grief and offered their support.\n\nAs the days passed, the mystery deepened. The police discovered that the man had been in good health and had no known medical conditions. They also found that he had been living a relatively normal life, with a steady job and a loving family.\n\nThe investigation continued, with the police examining every possible angle. They looked into the man’s personal life, his work, and his hobbies, searching for any clues that might shed light on his sudden death.\n\nAs the weeks went by, the community rallied around the man’s family, offering their support and prayers. They held memorial services and donated to charities in his name, showing the strength and resilience of the human spirit.\n\nFinally, after months of investigation, the police made a breakthrough. They discovered that the man had been the victim of a rare and mysterious illness, one that had been lurking in his body for years. The illness had gradually weakened his body, until one day, it finally took him.\n\nThe discovery brought some relief to the man’s family, who had been searching for answers for so long. They finally had some understanding of what had happened, and they could begin to heal.\n\nThe police also found some comfort in the discovery, knowing that they had finally uncovered the truth. They had done their job, and they had brought some closure to the man’s family.\n\nThis story is a reminder of the importance of our police officers, who work tirelessly to keep us safe and to bring justice to those who need it. It’s also a reminder of the strength of the human spirit, and the power of a community that comes together in times of need.\n\nSo, let us take comfort in the knowledge that the man’s family has found some answers, and let us continue to support our police officers and the communities they serve. Together, we can make our country a better place.\n\nThank you, and God bless you all.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":3081,"instruction_id_list_old":["keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Can you re-create a story from a fictional newspaper with title: \"A man mysteriously died in his house, and police are investigating\"?

Whether it's the first snowflakes of winter or the last warm days of summer, there's something magical about being surrounded by nature.\n\n\nFor those who are seasoned in the art of camping, the transition from summer to fall is a time of reflection and anticipation. The leaves turn to a tapestry of reds, oranges, and yellows, painting a picturesque backdrop for any outdoor adventure. It's a time to gather with friends and family, to share stories and laughter around a campfire.\n\n\nBut for those who are new to the world of camping, fear not. The transition from summer to fall is a time of growth and learning. It's an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and experience the beauty of the changing seasons.\n\n\nHere are a few tips for those embarking on their first fall camping trip:\n\n\n1. Dress in layers: The weather can be unpredictable, so it's important to be prepared. A few layers can make all the difference.\n\n2. Bring a tent: A sturdy tent will provide shelter from the elements and give you a place to rest.\n\n3. Pack plenty of food and water: No one wants to be stranded without food or water.\n\n4. Bring a first-aid kit: Accidents can happen, and it's important to be prepared.\n\n5.

She immediately called 911 and reported that her husband had collapsed and died. The first responders arrived on the scene and found John lying on the floor, unresponsive.\n\nThe initial examination by the medical examiner suggests that the cause of death was a heart attack. However, the circumstances surrounding the death are still being investigated. The police have launched a thorough investigation into the events leading up to the death, looking into possible foul play or other factors that may have contributed to the tragedy.\n\nThe community is left in a state of disbelief and grief, as they try to make sense of the sudden and tragic loss of a member of their own. The police have urged anyone with information to come forward and help them uncover the truth behind this mysterious death.\n\n#### Critique:\n\nAs the leader of the United States, I have always believed in the importance of a strong and just society.

This is a time for us to stand together and support one another, and to work towards a better, more just society.\n\nLet us take this opportunity to reflect on the importance of mental health, and the need for greater awareness and support for those struggling with mental health issues. Let us also remember the importance of community and the power of coming together to support one another in times of need.\n\nIn the face of tragedy, let us be guided by compassion, understanding, and a commitment to justice.

While the exact causes of ADHD are not fully understood, various factors such as genetics, environmental influences, and early life experiences are believed to contribute to its development. One potential environmental factor that has not been extensively studied is exposure to fast-phamed environments. This research aims to investigate the relationship between exposure to fast-paced environments and the likelihood of developing ADHD in children.\n\n\nResearch Questions:\n\n1. What is the prevalence of ADHD among children who have been exposed to fast-paced environments?\n\n2. What are the specific characteristics of fast-paced environments that may contribute to the development of ADHD?\n\n3. How do children who have been exposed to fast-paced environments differ from those who have not in terms of ADHD symptoms and severity?\n\n4. What are the potential mechanisms through which exposure to fast-paced environments may contribute to the development of ADHD?\n\n\nMethods:\n\n1. Participants: The study will recruit a diverse sample of children aged 6-12 years from various socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations.\n\n2. Measures: The primary outcome measure will be the diagnosis of ADHD, assessed by a qualified clinical psychologist using standardized diagnostic criteria. Secondary measures will include assessments of exposure to fast-paced environments, such as the frequency and duration of exposure, as well as the specific characteristics of these environments (e.g., noise levels, movement, and activity).\n\n3. Data collection: Information on exposure to fast-paced environments will be collected through parent and/or teacher reports, as well as direct observations of the children’s environments.\n\n4. Data analysis: Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine the association between exposure to fast-paced environments and the likelihood of developing ADHD.\n\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nThe results of this research will provide valuable insights into the potential role of fast-paced environments in the development of ADHD. If a significant association is found, this information can be used to inform prevention and intervention strategies for children at risk of developing ADHD.\n\n\nPotential Implications:\n\n1. Early identification of children at risk of developing ADHD due to exposure to fast-paced environments.\n\n2. Development of targeted interventions to reduce the impact of fast-paced environments on children’s mental health.\n\n3. Increased awareness among parents, educators, and policymakers about the potential risks of exposing children to fast-paced environments.\n\n4. Further research on the underlying mechanisms through which fast-paced environments may contribute to the development of ADHD.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis research will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the environmental factors that may contribute to the development of ADHD in children. By examining the relationship between exposure to fast-paced environments and ADHD, this study will help to identify potential risk factors and inform strategies to prevent and manage ADHD in children.","follow_all_instructions":true,"key":3506,"instruction_id_list_old":["detectable_format:json_format","keywords:forbidden_words"],"prompt_without_instruction":"Write a proposal for a research project that will determine whether pupils who have been exposed to a fast-paced environment are more likely to develop ADHD.","prompt_hash_subq":"c24a51f4b5db6c2f3340a4292e4f478f","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the proposal clearly define what constitutes a \"fast-paced environment\" and how it will be measured or identified in the context of the research?","Does the proposal outline a specific, testable hypothesis regarding the relationship between exposure to a fast-paced environment and the likelihood of developing ADHD?","Does the proposal detail the methodology that will be used to conduct the research, including sample selection, control groups, and the criteria for diagnosing ADHD?","Does the proposal include a plan for analyzing the data collected and how it will be used to support or refute the hypothesis?","Does the proposal address potential ethical considerations and how the well-being of participants will be protected throughout the study?"]},"old_prompt":"Write a proposal for a research project that will determine whether pupils who have been exposed to a fast-paced environment are more likely to develop ADHD.
