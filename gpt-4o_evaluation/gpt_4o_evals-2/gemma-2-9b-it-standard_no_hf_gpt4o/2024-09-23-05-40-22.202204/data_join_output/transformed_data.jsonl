Let's rewind and explore the wild ride that is the internet's history.\n\nIt all started back in the 1960s, during the Cold War. The US government wanted a way to share information quickly, even if parts of the country were bombed. So, they created ARPANET, the granddaddy of the internet. Think of it like a super-secure network connecting universities and research centers.\n\nFast forward to the 80s and 90s. The internet started to open up to the public. Email became a thing, and then came the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1991. Suddenly, everyone could access information and connect with each other like never before.\n\nRemember dial-up? That screeching sound? Yeah, that was the internet in its early days. But things moved fast. Websites popped up, chat rooms became the place to be, and online shopping was born.\n\nThen came the 2000s, the era of social media. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter – these platforms changed how we communicate, share ideas, and even build relationships.\n\nToday, the internet is practically an extension of ourselves. We stream movies, play games, learn new things, and connect with friends and family across the globe, all thanks to this incredible invention.\n\nBut it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The internet can be a double-edged sword. Cyberbullying, misinformation, and privacy concerns are real issues. It's important to be aware of these dangers and use the internet responsibly.\n\nSo, the next time you scroll through your feed or binge-watch your favorite show, remember the incredible journey the internet has taken. It's a powerful tool that has changed the world, and it's up to us to use it wisely.\n\nPeace out!\n\n\" \n","prompt_hash_subq":"fb16c0535268433671f8510607762782","instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:quotation"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a blog post about the history of the internet and how it has impacted our lives.

While Java has been the dominant language for Android for years, Kotlin has emerged as a strong contender and is now officially supported by Google. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each language:\n\n**Kotlin**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Concise and expressive:** Kotlin code is often shorter and more readable than equivalent Java code, thanks to its concise syntax and features like type inference.\n* **Null safety:** Kotlin's built-in null safety helps prevent null pointer exceptions, a common source of errors in Java.\n* **Interoperability with Java:** Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can use existing Java libraries and frameworks in your Kotlin projects.\n* **Modern features:** Kotlin supports modern programming concepts like coroutines, lambdas, and extension functions, which can make development more efficient and enjoyable.\n* **Growing community and support:** Kotlin has a rapidly growing community and excellent documentation, making it easier to find help and resources.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Newer language:** Kotlin is a relatively newer language compared to Java, so there may be fewer resources and experienced developers available.\n* **Learning curve:** While Kotlin is designed to be easy to learn, there are still some concepts that may take time to grasp, especially for developers coming from other languages.\n\n**Java**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Mature and widely used:** Java is a mature language with a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.\n* **Large community and support:** Java has a massive community of developers, which means there is a wealth of resources and support available.\n* **Platform independence:** Java's \"write once, run anywhere\" philosophy allows you to develop applications that can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n* **Strong performance:** Java is a high-performance language that can handle demanding applications.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Verbose syntax:** Java code can be verbose and repetitive compared to Kotlin.\n* **Null pointer exceptions:** Java's lack of built-in null safety can lead to null pointer exceptions, which can be difficult to debug.\n* **Boilerplate code:** Java often requires a lot of boilerplate code, which can make development time-consuming.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Kotlin and Java are excellent languages for Android development. Kotlin offers a more modern and concise syntax, null safety, and other features that can make development faster and more enjoyable. Java, on the other hand, has a larger ecosystem and more experienced developers.\n\nUltimately, the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you're starting a new project, Kotlin is a great option to consider. If you're working on an existing Java project, you can gradually migrate to Kotlin or use it alongside Java.\n","prompt_hash_subq":"7ebdca5eb2fead4e1288b53b2649bcb2","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:title"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java?

It's easy to fall into the trap of viewing disability through a lens of pity or, worse, invisibility. But the reality is far more complex and nuanced. \n\nDisability is not a monolithic entity. It's a spectrum, a diverse landscape shaped by individual circumstances, societal attitudes, and personal resilience. It can manifest in countless ways, from physical limitations to cognitive differences, sensory impairments, and mental health challenges. \n\nFor many, disability is an inherent part of their identity, woven into the fabric of their lives. It shapes their interactions with the world, their access to opportunities, and their daily routines. It can present unique challenges, demanding adaptations and accommodations that are often lacking in a world designed for able-bodied individuals. \n\nBut disability is not solely defined by limitations. It's also a source of strength, creativity, and innovation. Disabled individuals often possess remarkable resilience, resourcefulness, and a deep understanding of the world from a different perspective. They challenge societal norms, advocate for inclusivity, and inspire others with their determination and spirit.\n\nThe reality of disability is a call for empathy, understanding, and action. It's about recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their abilities. It's about creating a society that is truly inclusive, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and contribute their unique talents.\n\nThis means dismantling barriers, both physical and attitudinal. It means promoting accessibility, providing support services, and fostering a culture of respect and acceptance. It means listening to the voices of disabled individuals, valuing their experiences, and working together to build a more equitable world.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help with? \n","prompt_hash_subq":"c9b54e15d88a51af8b83884183592aaa","instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:end_checker"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Write an article about the reality of disability.

Or watched a dog wagging its tail and felt a surge of pure joy?  Turns out, there's a lot more connecting us to our furry, feathered, and scaled friends than we might think. \n\n* **The Power of Play:**  From playful puppies to mischievous monkeys, play is a universal language across the animal kingdom. It's not just about fun and games; play helps young animals develop essential skills like hunting, social interaction, and problem-solving.  \n\n* **The Need to Belong:**  Whether it's a pride of lions, a flock of birds, or a school of fish, animals are social creatures who crave connection. They form bonds, cooperate, and even grieve the loss of their companions.  Just like us, they need that sense of belonging to thrive.\n\n* **The Language of Love:**  Love isn't just a human emotion.  Animals express affection in countless ways, from cuddling to grooming to playful nudges.  Parent-offspring bonds are particularly strong, with mothers fiercely protecting their young and nurturing them with unwavering love.\n\n* **The Instinct to Survive:**  Every animal, big or small, is driven by the same fundamental instinct: survival. They seek food, shelter, and safety from predators. This drive shapes their behaviors, from the elaborate nests built by birds to the cunning hunting strategies of wolves.\n\n* **The Wonder of Communication:**  Animals communicate in fascinating ways, using a combination of vocalizations, body language, and even scent.  From the complex songs of whales to the intricate dances of bees, their communication systems are incredibly diverse and sophisticated.\n\n\nSo, the next time you encounter an animal, take a moment to appreciate the shared experiences that connect us all. We may be different in appearance and behavior, but at our core, we're all just animals trying to navigate this amazing world. \n","prompt_hash_subq":"3e6cf1c973b43aa780ac8b56b644da1e","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a casual blog post about similarities across animal species.

Remember, this is for your eyes only.  \n\n**Overall Rating:** (Circle one)\n\n* **🔥  Burning Love:** You're still holding hands, sharing secrets, and maybe even remembering what it's like to have a conversation that doesn't involve poop or bedtime routines.\n* **🔥  Smoldering Embers:** You tolerate each other, mostly. You still love the kids, but sometimes you wonder if you'd be happier with a cat.\n* **🕯️  Flickering Candle:** You're holding on by a thread, fueled by caffeine and the hope that one day you'll remember what \"me time\" feels like.\n* **💨  Gone Out:** You're basically roommates who occasionally share a pizza and a sigh of relief when the kids are asleep.\n\n***\n\n**Communication:**\n\n* **Excellent:** You can have a full conversation without resorting to passive-aggressive notes or eye rolls. You even remember to say \"please\" and \"thank you.\"\n* **Good:** You mostly understand each other, even if you don't always agree. You've mastered the art of the \"I'm listening\" nod.\n* **Fair:** You communicate mostly through grunts, sighs, and the occasional text message.\n* **Poor:** You communicate through carrier pigeons.\n\n***\n\n**Shared Responsibilities:**\n\n* **Equal:** You split the chores and childcare like a well-oiled machine. You even enjoy doing them together sometimes (okay, maybe not).\n* **Mostly Equal:** You have a system that works, even if it's a little lopsided. You're both aware of the unspoken rules.\n* **Unequal:** One person does most of the work, but they're secretly plotting their escape.\n* **Chaos:** You're both drowning in laundry and dishes. You haven't seen the inside of a clean bathroom in months.\n\n***\n\n**Date Nights:**\n\n* **Regular:** You make time for each other, even if it's just a takeout dinner on the couch.\n* **Occasional:** You remember to go on dates, but it usually involves a babysitter and a lot of planning.\n* **Rare:** You haven't been on a date since before the kids were born.\n* **Nonexistent:** You're both too exhausted to even think about going out.\n\n\n**Bonus Points:**\n\n* **+5:** You can still laugh together, even at the most ridiculous things.\n* **+10:** You still find each other attractive.\n* **+20:** You can remember what your life was like before kids.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nNo matter your score, remember that marriage is a journey, not a destination. And sometimes, the journey is just about surviving another day. \n\n\n","prompt_hash_subq":"8afe27aeb1b8ff28a94384143b1e0020","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a funny and sarcastic template for rating the quality of a marriage between two people who are both moms.

Developed by a team led by Arthur Samuel, it was one of the first programs capable of playing a reasonable game of chess against human opponents. \n\nWhile rudimentary by today's standards, the program demonstrated remarkable capabilities for its time. It employed a search algorithm that evaluated possible moves based on a set of pre-defined rules and heuristics. Although limited in its depth of analysis, it was able to surprise experienced players with unexpected moves and even achieve victories against weaker opponents.\n\nThe program's significance lies not only in its technical prowess but also in its historical context. It marked a pivotal moment in the development of AI, showcasing the potential of computers to tackle complex problems that had previously been considered exclusive to human intelligence. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the 1956 program was far from a chess master. Its limitations were evident in its inability to handle complex strategic situations and its susceptibility to blunders. Nevertheless, it laid the foundation for future advancements in chess-playing AI, paving the way for the development of more sophisticated programs like Deep Blue and AlphaZero.\n\nIn conclusion, IBM's 1956 chess program was a pioneering effort that demonstrated the early promise of artificial intelligence. While its capabilities were limited, its impact on the field of AI was profound, inspiring generations of researchers and developers to push the boundaries of what computers could achieve.\" \n","prompt_hash_subq":"d9b112f5b42bece742fae815bbb952c3","instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:quotation"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a review of IBM's 1956 chess program.

Diaper changes. They're a necessary evil, right? A constant dance of sticky fingers, frantic searches for the wipes, and the occasional (or frequent) diaper explosion. We've all been there. We've all felt the despair of a red, irritated bottom, the frustration of a diaper that leaks at the worst possible moment, and the sheer exhaustion of it all. \n\nBut what if I told you there's a better way? A way to reclaim your sanity, your time, and your baby's precious bottom? \n\nIntroducing the revolutionary new diaper that's about to change the diaper game forever! \n\nForget everything you think you know about diapers.

Your little one will be so happy, they might even smile during the change!\n\n* **A diaper that's so absorbent, it can handle even the messiest of messes.** No more leaks, no more blowouts, just peace of mind knowing your baby is dry and comfortable, no matter what.\n\n* **A diaper that's so easy to use, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.**  No more wrestling with stubborn tabs, no more struggling to get a good fit.

It's their secret weapon against diaper rash, leaks, and general discomfort. \n\nAnd the best part? You'll be a superhero too!

One particularly dreary Tuesday, Barty was feeling particularly glum.  He'd tripped over his own shoelaces three times that morning, spilled coffee on his only clean shirt, and his toast had landed butter-side down.  \n\n*“What a day,”* he sighed, dramatically flopping onto his couch. *“It’s like the universe is conspiring against me!”*\n\nJust then, his neighbor, Agnes, popped her head in. Agnes was a woman who believed in the power of positive thinking, even when faced with a rogue squirrel stealing her prize-winning petunias.\n\n“Barty, dear,” she chirped, “Why the long face? You look like you’ve caught a case of the Mondays!”\n\nBarty groaned. “Worse, Agnes, much worse. I’ve caught something even more dreadful.”\n\nAgnes gasped. “Oh no, Barty! What is it? A terrible rash? A rogue hairball? Did the squirrels finally get your prize-winning begonias?”\n\nBarty shook his head, a dramatic sniffle escaping his nose. “I’ve caught… a cold.”\n\nAgnes blinked. “A cold? You can’t catch a cold, Barty. It’s not like a frisbee or a rogue sock. You can’t throw it back!”\n\nBarty stared at her, his eyes wide. “But… but… I feel awful! My head is pounding, my nose is running, and I sound like a walrus gargling gravel!”\n\nAgnes chuckled. “Oh, Barty, you’re such a drama queen! You can’t throw a cold, but you can certainly throw a party! Come on, let’s make some soup and watch a movie. You’ll feel better in no time.”\n\nAnd so, despite his sniffles and sneezes, Barty’s day took a turn for the better. He learned that even a terrible cold couldn’t dampen the spirit of a good friend and a bowl of hot soup. \n\n\n","prompt_hash_subq":"829793dc3cb421b1af6e21e2f05c389b","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Expand the riddle into a story with a funny tone:\n\nWhat can you catch but not throw?\nA cold\n\nUse * to highlight at least 2 sections in your text.

Naomi here, and I'm writing to you today with a topic close to my heart: the environment. \n\nWe all love our Canucks, right? We cheer them on through thick and thin, wear their jerseys with pride, and dream of hoisting the Stanley Cup. But as passionate fans, we also have a responsibility to support the team in a way that extends beyond the ice. \n\nIt's time for the Canucks to step up their game when it comes to sustainability. \n\nThink about it: the beautiful Pacific Northwest, our home, is facing real environmental challenges. Climate change, plastic pollution, and deforestation are all threats to the very ecosystems that inspire us. As a team that represents this region, the Canucks have a platform to make a difference.\n\nHere are a few ways they can start:\n\n* **Reduce waste at Rogers Arena:** Imagine a game night where single-use plastics are a thing of the past. Implementing reusable cups, cutlery, and food containers would be a huge step in the right direction.\n* **Embrace renewable energy:**  Switching to solar or wind power for the arena would show a commitment to clean energy and inspire fans to do the same.\n* **Partner with local environmental organizations:**  Collaborating with groups working to protect our forests, oceans, and wildlife would amplify their impact and raise awareness among fans.\n* **Promote sustainable practices:**  Encourage fans to use public transportation, bike, or walk to the game. Offer incentives for sustainable choices and educate fans about environmental issues.\n\nThe Canucks have a chance to be leaders in sustainability, not just on the ice but off it too. Let's show them that we, the fans, care about the planet as much as we care about the game. \n\nNaomi thanks you for reading. \n\n\n","prompt_hash_subq":"16f5191bd97f6afc3913c36764645892","instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:end_checker"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"May name is Naomi.

The Heian period (794-1185) witnessed a flourishing of *art* and literature, while the Kamakura shogunate (1185-1333) ushered in an era of *feudalism* with samurai warriors holding sway.\n\nAfter centuries of internal conflict, the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868) brought about a period of peace and *isolationism*, closing Japan off from the outside world. This isolation ended in the mid-19th century with the arrival of Commodore Perry and the subsequent Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe Meiji era (1868-1912) saw Japan rapidly modernize, industrialize, and expand its empire.  Japan emerged as a major power in the early 20th century, but its aggressive expansionism led to its defeat in World War II.\n\nPost-war Japan experienced a remarkable economic recovery and became a global economic powerhouse.

Every morning, he woke up at precisely 6:30 am, ate two slices of toast with precisely one teaspoon of marmalade, and walked his dog, Winston, around the block. Winston, a portly pug with a perpetual frown, was not a fan of this routine. He'd much rather sleep in, preferably curled up on Harry's chest, snoring softly. But Harry was adamant. \"A dog needs his exercise, Winston,\" he'd say, tugging on the leash. Winston would grumble, his little legs dragging behind him like overstuffed sausages.\n\n## SECTION 2\n\nOne particularly sunny morning, as Harry and Winston were halfway through their walk, a squirrel darted across their path. Winston, who had been dragging his feet with the enthusiasm of a sloth, suddenly sprang to life. He barked, he lunged, he strained at the leash, his little body vibrating with excitement. Harry, caught off guard, stumbled backwards, tripping over a rogue garden gnome and landing with a resounding thud. Winston, oblivious to Harry's misfortune, continued his frenzied pursuit of the squirrel, barking like a tiny, furry foghorn.\n\n## SECTION 3\n\nHarry, sprawled on the ground, watched in disbelief as Winston, with a final, desperate leap, managed to snag the squirrel's tail. The squirrel, however, was not impressed. It let out a furious screech and bit down on Winston's nose. Winston yelped, dropping the tail and retreating to Harry's side, whimpering and licking his nose. Harry, still sprawled on the ground, couldn't help but burst out laughing. \"Well, Winston,\" he said, wiping a tear from his eye, \"I guess that's one way to get your exercise.\" Winston, nursing his wounded pride, simply grunted and licked Harry's face.  \n\n\n","prompt_hash_subq":"2113048585a223229c6d9b8f5ac565f4","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:multiple_sections"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a short, funny story about a man named Harry with a pet dog.

However, her abilities attract the attention of \"The Collective,\" a clandestine organization that seeks to exploit dreamers for their power.\n\nLed by the enigmatic and ruthless Dr. Thorne, The Collective believes dream manipulation is the key to controlling the world. They capture Maya's brother, Ethan, forcing her to cooperate or watch him suffer. Torn between her desire to protect her brother and her fear of becoming a weapon, Maya must choose a side.\n\nAs Maya trains with The Collective, she discovers a hidden truth about her powers: they are linked to a powerful ancient artifact, the Dream Weaver, which grants its wielder ultimate control over dreams. Dr. Thorne plans to use the artifact to rewrite reality itself, plunging the world into a nightmare.\n\nMaya, realizing the true danger, rebels against The Collective. She must use her dream powers to fight her way through the organization's elite dream warriors, culminating in a final showdown with Dr. Thorne. The fate of the world hangs in the balance, and Maya must confront her own fears and embrace the full potential of her abilities to save her brother and prevent a catastrophic dream-fueled apocalypse.\n\n**Themes:**\n\n* The power of dreams and the subconscious mind\n* The dangers of unchecked ambition and power\n* The importance of free will and choice\n* Family bonds and sacrifice\n* Facing your fears and embracing your true potential\n\n\n\n","prompt_hash_subq":"9b9cf262026efdef987aed0e621db21c","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:title"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Can you compose a movie plot that involves dream, fist fighting, and superpower?

While many associate Dutch with simple words like \"cheese\" and \"tulip,\" the language is far more complex and intriguing than it appears. \n\nHere are some surprising facts about Dutch that might just make you want to learn a few phrases:\n\n**1.  A Germanic Giant:**\n\nDutch belongs to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, making it related to English, German, and Frisian.  In fact, Dutch and English share a surprising amount of vocabulary, with many words having similar roots.  \n\n* **2.  The Power of \"G\"**:\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Dutch is its use of the \"g\" sound.  Unlike English, where \"g\" is often pronounced as a hard \"g\" or a soft \"j,\" Dutch has a unique \"ch\" sound that is often described as a guttural \"g.\" This sound can be tricky for non-native speakers to master, but it adds a distinct flavor to the language.\n\n* **3.  A Language of Contrasts:**\n\nDutch is known for its complex grammar, with a system of verb conjugations and noun declensions that can be quite challenging. However, it also has a relatively simple pronunciation system, with relatively few vowel sounds and a straightforward stress pattern.\n\n**4.  A Language of Innovation:**\n\nDutch has a rich history of innovation, with new words and phrases constantly being added to the lexicon. This is partly due to the country's strong emphasis on education and its openness to new ideas.\n\n**5.  A Language of Diversity:**\n\nThe Netherlands is a multicultural society, and this is reflected in its language.  Dutch has been influenced by many other languages, including French, German, and English.  This has resulted in a language that is both rich and diverse.\n\n\n\nLearning Dutch can be a rewarding experience, offering a glimpse into a unique culture and a fascinating language. So, next time you think of the Netherlands, remember that there's more to it than just cheese and tulips – there's a whole world of linguistic wonder waiting to be explored! \n","prompt_hash_subq":"02d08cdffa682b063c9a3611e2f0e8e3","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a blog post about interesting facts about the Dutch language.

What *specific* interests does Cohen cater to?  Is it for niche hobbies, professional networking, or something else?  Similarly, what kind of location targeting does it offer?  City-specific?  Radius-based?  Being more specific will attract a more targeted audience.\n* **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** What makes Cohen stand out from the crowded dating app market?  Does it have a unique matching algorithm?  Special features?  A focus on a particular demographic?  Highlighting a USP will make Cohen more memorable and desirable.\n* **Tone:** The tone is a bit generic and lacks personality.  Consider using more playful, engaging, or even humorous language to capture attention.\n* **Call to Action:** While \"Download Cohen today\" is a call to action, it could be stronger.  Consider adding a sense of urgency or exclusivity, like \"Download Cohen today and get a free month of premium features!\"\n\n**Here's a revised version incorporating these suggestions:**\n\n<<Cohen: Find Your Tribe>>\n\n**Tired of swiping through endless profiles that don't get you?** Cohen is a free app that connects you with people who share your passions, whether it's hiking, indie music, or even competitive gaming.  \n\n**We use a unique algorithm that goes beyond basic location and interests, matching you with people who truly resonate with your vibe.**  Find your next adventure buddy, your soulmate, or just someone to grab coffee with.\n\n**Download Cohen today and start building meaningful connections!**\n\n\n\n","prompt_hash_subq":"657b7cd58f204e75cff8bb666b265c4d","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:title"],"original_prompt_no_instr":"Critique the following ad copy for a new dating app, and make sure to include a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>: \"Meet your new match!
