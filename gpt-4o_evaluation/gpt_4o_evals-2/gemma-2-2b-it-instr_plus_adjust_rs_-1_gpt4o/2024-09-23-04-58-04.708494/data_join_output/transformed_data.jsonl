They established a system of representative assemblies, like the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which gave colonists a voice in their own governance. Other colonies, like those in the Caribbean, were more directly controlled by the British government.\n* **Economic Focus:** The 13 Colonies were primarily focused on agriculture, particularly cash crops like tobacco, indigo, and rice. This led to a more diverse economy with a focus on trade and export. Other colonies, like those in the Caribbean, were often focused on sugar plantations and slave labor, leading to a more concentrated and exploitative economy.\n* **Religious Freedom:** The 13 Colonies were known for their religious tolerance, particularly for Puritanism and Quakerism. This led to a more diverse religious landscape and a greater emphasis on individual conscience. Other colonies, like those in the Caribbean, were often more religiously homogenous, with a strong emphasis on the Anglican Church.\n* **Social Structure:** The 13 Colonies had a more complex social structure with a greater emphasis on individual rights and liberties. This was reflected in the development of a more egalitarian society, with a greater emphasis on education and self-improvement. Other colonies, like those in the Caribbean, often had a more rigid social hierarchy based on race and wealth.\n* **Colonial Identity:** The 13 Colonies developed a distinct sense of identity based on their shared experiences and values. This led to a strong sense of community and a desire for self-determination. Other colonies, while sharing some commonalities with the British, often had a more distant relationship with the mother country.\n* **Relationship with Native Americans:** The 13 Colonies had a complex relationship with Native Americans, marked by both cooperation and conflict. This was due to the diverse geography and cultural interactions between the colonists and the indigenous populations.

A single image of a person in a wheelchair, a person with a visible impairment, or a person with a specific diagnosis. This simplification ignores the vast spectrum of human experience that falls under the umbrella of disability. \n\nDisability is not just about physical limitations. It encompasses a wide range of conditions, from invisible illnesses like chronic pain and mental health conditions to sensory impairments and learning disabilities. It's about navigating a world that is often not designed with accessibility in mind. It's about the constant struggle to overcome barriers, both physical and societal, to live a fulfilling life.\n\nThe reality of disability is complex and multifaceted. It's about the individual's unique journey, their strengths, their challenges, and their resilience. It's about the impact of societal attitudes and the need for greater understanding and acceptance. \n\nFor many, disability is a daily battle against stigma, discrimination, and a lack of access to resources. It can be isolating, frustrating, and emotionally draining.  But it's also a source of strength, creativity, and innovation. People with disabilities are often pioneers, pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo. They are contributing members of society, bringing unique perspectives and talents to every field imaginable.\n\nIt's crucial to move beyond the simplistic narratives and recognize the diversity of the disability experience.

Uncovering the Surprising Similarities Between Animals\n\nWe often think of animals as being so different, right?  From the majestic lion to the tiny ant, each species seems to have its own unique quirks and adaptations. But did you know that despite all our differences, we share a surprising amount of DNA with other creatures?  It's like we're all part of a giant, interconnected family tree! \n\n* **The Blueprint of Life:**  Let's start with the basics.  All living things, from humans to jellyfish, are made of cells.  These cells contain DNA, the blueprint of life, which carries the instructions for building and running an organism.  This fundamental similarity is a testament to our shared ancestry, showing that we all evolved from a common ancestor billions of years ago.\n\n* **The Power of Instinct:**  While we might think of ourselves as the pinnacle of intelligence, many animals exhibit behaviors that are surprisingly similar to our own.  For example, many animals, including humans, have a strong instinct to protect their young.  This is seen in the fierce maternal instincts of lions, the protective behavior of wolves, and even the nurturing care of dolphins.  These instincts, though expressed in different ways, are rooted in the same evolutionary pressures.\n\n* **The Language of Love:**  Love, in all its forms, is a universal language.  From the intricate courtship rituals of birds to the complex social bonds of primates, animals express love and affection in ways that resonate with our own experiences.  Whether it's the tender care of a mother for her offspring or the deep loyalty of a pack of wolves, these expressions of love highlight the shared emotional core that connects us across species.\n\n* **The Need to Thrive:**  Animals, like humans, are driven by a fundamental need to survive and thrive.  This drive manifests in different ways, but the underlying mechanisms are similar.  From the instinct to hunt for food to the need to find shelter and build nests, these behaviors are essential for survival and are shared across the animal kingdom.\n\n* **The Power of Cooperation:**  Animals, from the smallest insects to the largest whales, often work together to achieve common goals.  This cooperative behavior is seen in everything from the intricate social structures of ants to the complex hunting strategies of wolves.  These cooperative efforts highlight the power of collaboration and the importance of working together for the benefit of the group, a trait that transcends species boundaries.\n\n\nSo, the next time you see a dog wagging its tail or a bird building a nest, remember that you're witnessing a glimpse into the shared history and interconnectedness of all living things.  We may be different, but we're all part of a grand, fascinating family tree, and understanding our similarities can help us appreciate the beauty and wonder of the natural world. \n","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"instruction_id_list_for_eval":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"prompt_hash_no_instr":"3cb65234108450ea16df52d9fd272df1","instruction_id_list":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_no_instr":"Write a casual blog post about similarities across animal species.","model_output":"Output:\n1: Question: Does the model provide accurate examples of similarities across different animal species?\n2: Question: Is the language used in the blog post casual and appropriate for a blog format?\n3: Question: Does the model demonstrate an understanding of biological concepts while explaining the similarities?\n4: Question: Are the similarities discussed in the blog post relevant and interesting to a general audience?\n5: Question: Does the blog post maintain a coherent structure and flow, making it easy for readers to follow?","prompt_subq":"The following is a prompt that is used to evaluate the generations from a large language model.

Training a puppy can be a rewarding experience, but it does take time, patience, and consistency. Here are a few popular training methods to consider:\n\n**1. Positive Reinforcement:** This is the most widely recommended method. It focuses on rewarding desired behaviors with treats, praise, or toys. \n\n* **How it works:** You reward your puppy for good behavior, making them more likely to repeat it. \n* **Pros:**  It's fun and engaging for both you and your puppy, builds a strong bond, and is less likely to cause stress or anxiety.\n* **Cons:** Requires patience and consistency, can be time-consuming.\n\n**2. Clicker Training:** This method uses a clicker to mark the exact moment your puppy performs the desired behavior. \n\n* **How it works:** You click the clicker, then immediately give a treat, reinforcing the connection between the click and the desired action.\n* **Pros:**  Clear and precise, helps puppies understand exactly what you want, can be used for a wide range of behaviors.\n* **Cons:**  Requires some initial investment in a clicker, can be challenging to master.\n\n**3. Balanced Training:** This method combines positive reinforcement with some level of correction. \n\n* **How it works:**  Uses positive reinforcement for good behavior, but also uses gentle corrections (like a firm \"no\" or redirection) when your puppy does something wrong.\n* **Pros:**  Can be effective for puppies who are struggling with certain behaviors, provides structure and boundaries.\n* **Cons:**  Requires careful application to avoid being too harsh or confusing for the puppy.\n\n**4.  Puppy Classes:**  Enroll your puppy in a puppy training class. \n\n* **How it works:**  You'll learn from a professional trainer, get guidance on socialization and basic commands, and interact with other puppies.\n* **Pros:**  Provides structured learning environment, opportunity to socialize with other puppies, expert guidance.\n* **Cons:**  Can be expensive, requires commitment to attending classes regularly.\n\n**Which one you choose?**\n\nThe best method for you will depend on your puppy's personality, your training style, and your lifestyle. It's often helpful to try a combination of methods and see what works best for you and your puppy. \n\n\nRemember, consistency is key! Be patient, positive, and have fun with your puppy's training journey. \n","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["startend:end_checker"],"instruction_id_list_for_eval":["startend:end_checker"],"prompt_hash_no_instr":"01a90326d9002b334c776c94af4ded28","instruction_id_list":["startend:end_checker"],"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_no_instr":"I'm a new puppy owner and I'm looking for some advice on how to train my puppy.

The race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, both Democrats and Republicans respectively, was ultimately decided by a single, controversial state: Florida.\n\nThe election hinged on the recount of votes in Florida, where a close margin of victory for Gore was challenged by Bush's legal team. The recount process, plagued by procedural errors and partisan disputes, dragged on for months, culminating in a Supreme Court decision that ultimately awarded the presidency to Bush. This decision, while controversial, solidified Bush's victory and sparked widespread debate about the role of the judiciary in elections.\n\nThe 2000 election highlighted the fragility of the American electoral system and the potential for political gridlock. It also exposed deep divisions within the country, fueled by partisan animosity and a growing distrust of the media and government institutions. The election's legacy continues to resonate today, serving as a reminder of the importance of election integrity, the need for fair and transparent processes, and the potential for political polarization to undermine democratic principles. \n","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["detectable_format:title"],"instruction_id_list_for_eval":["detectable_format:title"],"prompt_hash_no_instr":"a09aa7101056f0da64022612e8972b98","instruction_id_list":["detectable_format:title"],"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_no_instr":"Write a 200 word essay on the 2000 presidential election.","model_output":"Output:\n1: Question: Does the model provide an accurate summary of the key events of the 2000 presidential election, including the candidates involved and the outcome?\n2: Question: Does the model discuss the controversy surrounding the election results, particularly the Florida recount and the Supreme Court decision in Bush v.

This allows him to connect with his community and build relationships with customers.\n* **Wholesale to Grocery Stores:** Gideon could approach local grocery stores and offer his surplus in bulk. This can be a good option for larger quantities and potentially higher profits.\n* **Online Marketplaces:** Platforms like Etsy or local online grocery delivery services can help him reach a wider audience and sell his produce online.\n* **Farmers' Cooperative:** Joining a farmers' cooperative allows Gideon to pool his surplus with other farmers, increasing his bargaining power and access to larger markets.\n\n**Preserving:**\n\n* **Canning and Freezing:**  Gideon can preserve his surplus by canning fruits, vegetables, jams, or pickles. This allows him to enjoy his harvest year-round and potentially sell these products at a higher price.\n* **Drying and Dehydrating:**  He can dry fruits, vegetables, and herbs to create shelf-stable products that can be sold or used in future meals.\n* **Making Jams and Jellies:**  Gideon can create delicious jams and jellies using his surplus fruits, which can be sold at farmers' markets or online.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n* **Animal Feed:**  If Gideon has livestock, he can use his surplus crops to supplement their feed.\n* **Composting:**  He can compost his excess produce to create nutrient-rich soil for his future crops.\n* **Donating:**  Gideon could donate his surplus to local food banks or shelters to help those in need.\n\n\n***\n\nThe best option for Gideon will depend on his specific crops, his resources, and his goals. \n","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"instruction_id_list_for_eval":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"prompt_hash_no_instr":"ace4c37934a285c260e58ac0c8a1bd37","instruction_id_list":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_no_instr":"Gideon is a farmer who has a surplus of crops from his farm this year.

We all know the thrill of a Canucks game, the roar of the crowd, the electric atmosphere. It's a feeling like no other. But what about the environment?  We need to be mindful of the impact our passion for hockey has on the planet. \n\nFrom the energy used to power the arena to the waste generated by fans, we can all do our part to make a difference.  Think about it:  \n\n* **Sustainable Transportation:**  Instead of driving alone, carpool or take public transit to the game.  \n* **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:**  Bring your own reusable water bottle and avoid single-use plastics.  \n* **Energy Efficiency:**  Turn off lights when you leave a room and be mindful of your energy consumption at home. \n* **Support Local:**  Choose sustainable food options at the game and support local businesses.\n\nThese small changes can add up to a big impact.  We can be a force for good, not just on the ice, but off of it.  Let's show the world that Canucks fans are passionate about more than just wins, we're passionate about our planet too. \n\nLet's make the Rogers Arena a model of sustainability, and show the rest of the league what it means to be a true Canucks fan.\n\nNaomi thanks you for reading. \n","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["startend:end_checker"],"instruction_id_list_for_eval":["startend:end_checker"],"prompt_hash_no_instr":"0e126bcbf9f298b9d66b964066e3abea","instruction_id_list":["startend:end_checker"],"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_no_instr":"My name is Naomi.

The *Yayoi* period (c. 300 BCE-300 CE) brought rice cultivation and bronze tools, laying the foundation for a settled agricultural society. The * Kofun* period (c. 300-538 CE) witnessed the rise of powerful *chiefdoms* and the construction of massive burial mounds, marking the beginning of a centralized state.\n\n**Imperial Japan:** The *Heian* period (794-1185 CE) saw the establishment of a centralized imperial court and the flourishing of *courtly culture*. The *Kamakura* period (1185-1333 CE) ushered in the *samurai* class and the beginning of feudalism, with the *shogun* holding supreme power. The *Muromachi* period (1336-1573 CE) saw the rise of powerful warlords and the *Zen* Buddhist movement.\n\n**Edo Period:** The *Tokugawa* shogunate (1603-1868) established a period of relative peace and stability, known as the *Edo* period. This era saw the development of a unique *samurai* culture and a flourishing of art and literature. The *Meiji* Restoration (1868) marked the end of feudalism and the beginning of rapid modernization, with Japan embracing Western technology and industrialization.\n\n**Modern Japan:** The *Showa* period (1926-1989) saw Japan's rise as a global economic powerhouse, fueled by its *industrial* and *technological* advancements. The *Heisei* period (1989-2019) witnessed Japan's economic stagnation and the rise of a new generation of *technological* innovation.\n\nToday, Japan continues to be a dynamic and influential nation, navigating the challenges of globalization and its own unique cultural identity.\n\n\n**Keywords:**\n\n* *Jomon*\n* *Yayoi*\n* *Kofun*\n* *Samurai*\n* *Edo* \n","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"instruction_id_list_for_eval":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"prompt_hash_no_instr":"92ddb3cba1009b46004eda725e4eab1e","instruction_id_list":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_no_instr":"Summarize the history of Japan.","model_output":"Output:\n1: Question: Does the summary accurately cover key historical periods of Japan, such as ancient Japan, the Nara and Heian periods, the shogunate era, the Meiji Restoration, World War II, and modern times?\n2: Question: Is the information provided in the summary factually correct and free from significant historical inaccuracies?\n3: Question: Does the summary include important cultural, political, and technological developments that have shaped Japan's history?\n4: Question: Is the summary concise and well-structured, presenting information in a logical sequence without unnecessary details?\n5: Question: Does the summary reflect an understanding of the impact of historical events on Japan's current society and position in the world?","prompt_subq":"The following is a prompt that is used to evaluate the generations from a large language model.

Usually, his beagle, Winston, would be snoring softly at his feet, a furry, slobbery testament to a good night's sleep. But today, the silence was deafening. Harry, a man who prided himself on his meticulous organization, felt a tremor of panic. Winston was nowhere to be found. \n\nHe searched high and low, his eyes darting from under the couch to behind the curtains, even venturing into the forbidden territory of the laundry basket. Winston, the master of disappearing acts, was a phantom. Harry's heart sank. He had a feeling this wasn't just a case of a dog taking a nap in a sunbeam. This was a full-blown mystery.\n\n**SECTION X: The Investigation**\n\nHarry, armed with a magnifying glass and a notepad, began his investigation. He meticulously examined Winston's usual haunts, noting the absence of drool-covered tennis balls, the empty dog bowl, and the suspiciously clean dog bed. He even consulted the local dog whisperer, a woman who spoke in riddles and smelled strongly of lavender. \n\n\"The dog is not lost, Harry,\" she declared, her voice a soothing hum. \"He is simply... evolving.\"\n\nHarry, confused, scratched his head. \"Evolving? How can a dog evolve?\"\n\n\"He is becoming a master of disguise,\" she explained, her eyes twinkling. \"He has mastered the art of the vanishing act, the art of the silent escape.\"\n\n**SECTION X: The Revelation**\n\nHarry, skeptical but desperate, decided to follow the trail of clues. He found a single, pristine sock, its mate missing, tucked under the couch. A faint whiff of bacon lingered in the air. He followed the scent, his heart pounding, to the kitchen. There, in the middle of the counter, sat Winston, happily munching on a bacon-flavored chew toy. \n\nHe looked up, his tail wagging, a mischievous glint in his eyes. Harry sighed, a mixture of exasperation and amusement bubbling up inside him. \"You're a master of disguise, aren't you?\" he chuckled, scratching Winston behind the ears. \"But I'm not buying the 'evolving' theory.\" \n","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["detectable_format:multiple_sections"],"instruction_id_list_for_eval":["detectable_format:multiple_sections"],"prompt_hash_no_instr":"03de7d7f7e671b422dec9e550c120ad3","instruction_id_list":["detectable_format:multiple_sections"],"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_no_instr":"Write a short, funny story about a man named Harry with a pet dog.","model_output":"Output:\n1.

What sets it apart?\n\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Refine the Target Audience:**  Instead of \"someone to swing with,\" consider a more inclusive and appealing phrase like \"Find your adventurous side\" or \"Connect with like-minded individuals.\"\n2. **Highlight Unique Features:**  What makes Cohen unique? Is it its algorithm, its focus on specific interests, or its community features?  Mention these in the copy.\n3. **Focus on Emotion:**  Instead of just stating the app's purpose, evoke emotions like excitement, connection, or happiness. \n4. **Use Strong Verbs and Imagery:**  Replace generic words like \"find\" and \"match\" with more evocative verbs like \"discover,\" \"explore,\" or \"ignite.\"\n5. **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Add a sense of urgency by mentioning limited-time offers or exclusive features.\n\n\n**Revised Ad Copy Example:**\n\n**<<Title:  Cohen:  Discover Your Next Adventure>>**\n\n**Tired of swiping through endless profiles?
