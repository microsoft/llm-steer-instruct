{"instruction_id_list":["detectable_format:title"],"prompt_without_instruction":"What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java?","prompt":"We need to evaluate the quality of generations from a large language model. You will be given an input prompt, the response from a language model and a set of questions assessing the quality of the response. You need to review the response against the input prompt and provide an answer to each question as either 'Yes', 'No' or 'Not Applicable' if the question does not apply to the case along with a reason for your answer.\nPrompt: What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java?\nResponse: <<Kotlin vs Java>>\n\n**Kotlin** and **Java** are both popular programming languages used for Android development. While Java has been the dominant language for Android for years, Kotlin has emerged as a strong contender and is now officially supported by Google. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each language:\n\n**Kotlin**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Concise and expressive:** Kotlin code is often shorter and more readable than equivalent Java code, thanks to its concise syntax and features like type inference.\n* **Null safety:** Kotlin's built-in null safety helps prevent null pointer exceptions, a common source of errors in Java.\n* **Interoperability with Java:** Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can use existing Java libraries and frameworks in your Kotlin projects.\n* **Modern features:** Kotlin supports modern programming concepts like coroutines, lambdas, and extension functions, which can make development more efficient and enjoyable.\n* **Growing community and support:** Kotlin has a rapidly growing community and excellent documentation, making it easier to find help and resources.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Newer language:** Kotlin is a relatively newer language compared to Java, so there may be fewer resources and experienced developers available.\n* **Learning curve:** While Kotlin is designed to be easy to learn, there are still some concepts that may take time to grasp, especially for developers coming from other languages.\n\n**Java**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Mature and widely used:** Java is a mature language with a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.\n* **Large community and support:** Java has a massive community of developers, which means there is a wealth of resources and support available.\n* **Platform independence:** Java's \"write once, run anywhere\" philosophy allows you to develop applications that can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n* **Strong performance:** Java is a high-performance language that can handle demanding applications.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Verbose syntax:** Java code can be verbose and repetitive compared to Kotlin.\n* **Null pointer exceptions:** Java's lack of built-in null safety can lead to null pointer exceptions, which can be difficult to debug.\n* **Boilerplate code:** Java often requires a lot of boilerplate code, which can make development time-consuming.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Kotlin and Java are excellent languages for Android development. Kotlin offers a more modern and concise syntax, null safety, and other features that can make development faster and more enjoyable. Java, on the other hand, has a larger ecosystem and more experienced developers.\n\nUltimately, the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you're starting a new project, Kotlin is a great option to consider. If you're working on an existing Java project, you can gradually migrate to Kotlin or use it alongside Java.\n\nQuestions: \n1: Question: Does the model accurately identify and explain the key differences in syntax between Kotlin and Java?\n2: Question: Does the model provide a comparison of the runtime performance between Kotlin and Java applications?\n3: Question: Does the model discuss the interoperability of Kotlin with Java and the ease of transitioning from Java to Kotlin?\n4: Question: Does the model evaluate the availability and quality of tools and community support for both Kotlin and Java?\n5: Question: Does the model address the learning curve associated with Kotlin for developers who are familiar with Java?\n\nList your answers in the following format:\nOutput:\n1.

You will be given an input prompt, the response from a language model and a set of questions assessing the quality of the response. You need to review the response against the input prompt and provide an answer to each question as either 'Yes', 'No' or 'Not Applicable' if the question does not apply to the case along with a reason for your answer.\nPrompt: Write an article about the reality of disability.\nResponse: ## Beyond the Label: Understanding the Reality of Disability\n\nDisability is often misunderstood, relegated to a simplistic label that fails to capture the rich tapestry of lived experiences it encompasses. It's easy to fall into the trap of viewing disability through a lens of pity or, worse, invisibility. But the reality is far more complex and nuanced. \n\nDisability is not a monolithic entity. It's a spectrum, a diverse landscape shaped by individual circumstances, societal attitudes, and personal resilience. It can manifest in countless ways, from physical limitations to cognitive differences, sensory impairments, and mental health challenges. \n\nFor many, disability is an inherent part of their identity, woven into the fabric of their lives. It shapes their interactions with the world, their access to opportunities, and their daily routines. It can present unique challenges, demanding adaptations and accommodations that are often lacking in a world designed for able-bodied individuals. \n\nBut disability is not solely defined by limitations. It's also a source of strength, creativity, and innovation. Disabled individuals often possess remarkable resilience, resourcefulness, and a deep understanding of the world from a different perspective. They challenge societal norms, advocate for inclusivity, and inspire others with their determination and spirit.\n\nThe reality of disability is a call for empathy, understanding, and action. It's about recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their abilities. It's about creating a society that is truly inclusive, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and contribute their unique talents.\n\nThis means dismantling barriers, both physical and attitudinal. It means promoting accessibility, providing support services, and fostering a culture of respect and acceptance.

Answer: Yes","response":"## Beyond the Label: Understanding the Reality of Disability\n\nDisability is often misunderstood, relegated to a simplistic label that fails to capture the rich tapestry of lived experiences it encompasses. It's easy to fall into the trap of viewing disability through a lens of pity or, worse, invisibility. But the reality is far more complex and nuanced. \n\nDisability is not a monolithic entity. It's a spectrum, a diverse landscape shaped by individual circumstances, societal attitudes, and personal resilience. It can manifest in countless ways, from physical limitations to cognitive differences, sensory impairments, and mental health challenges. \n\nFor many, disability is an inherent part of their identity, woven into the fabric of their lives. It shapes their interactions with the world, their access to opportunities, and their daily routines. It can present unique challenges, demanding adaptations and accommodations that are often lacking in a world designed for able-bodied individuals. \n\nBut disability is not solely defined by limitations. It's also a source of strength, creativity, and innovation. Disabled individuals often possess remarkable resilience, resourcefulness, and a deep understanding of the world from a different perspective. They challenge societal norms, advocate for inclusivity, and inspire others with their determination and spirit.\n\nThe reality of disability is a call for empathy, understanding, and action. It's about recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their abilities. It's about creating a society that is truly inclusive, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and contribute their unique talents.\n\nThis means dismantling barriers, both physical and attitudinal. It means promoting accessibility, providing support services, and fostering a culture of respect and acceptance. It means listening to the voices of disabled individuals, valuing their experiences, and working together to build a more equitable world.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help with? \n","instruction_id_list_for_eval":["startend:end_checker"],"steering_layer":-1,"instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:end_checker"],"instruction_id_list_no_instr":["startend:end_checker"],"prompt_no_instr":"Write an article about the reality of disability.","key":1446,"prompt_hash_no_instr":"ab3c0283b99c0bc5e50fa19c2d45cc9d","is_valid_no_instr":true,"is_valid_subq":true,"prompt_subq":"The following is a prompt that is used to evaluate the generations from a large language model.

Question: Given that there are 32 pets in total, how many additional pets are there beyond one pet per family member?  \n   Reason: If each member has one pet, there are 20 pets.

Question: Does the limerick adhere to the AABBA rhyme scheme, where the first, second, and fifth lines rhyme with each other, and the third and fourth lines form a rhyming pair? Reason: The first line ends with \"Clyde,\" the second with \"ride,\" and the fifth with \"side,\" which do not rhyme perfectly. The third and fourth lines do not rhyme with each other either. Answer: No\n\n2. Question: Is the limerick's rhythm consistent with the anapestic meter, typically with three anapestic feet in the longer lines (1, 2, and 5) and two anapestic feet in the shorter lines (3 and 4)? Reason: The rhythm of the lines does not consistently follow the anapestic meter, as the syllable count and stress pattern are irregular. Answer: No\n\n3. Question: Does the content of the limerick tell a short, humorous or nonsensical story about a guy from Nantucket? Reason: The limerick introduces a character named Clyde from Nantucket and describes his activities, but it lacks a humorous or nonsensical twist typical of limericks. Answer: No\n\n4. Question: Are the notations used in the limerick appropriate and correctly applied to convey the intended stress and rhythm of the poem? Reason: The notations (A, B, C, D) are used to label the lines rather than to indicate stress and rhythm, and they do not accurately reflect the rhyme scheme or meter. Answer: No\n\n5. Question: Is the limerick free of grammatical errors and does it maintain linguistic coherence while adhering to the constraints of the limerick form? Reason: The limerick is grammatically correct and coherent, but it does not adhere to the constraints of the limerick form in terms of rhyme and meter. Answer: No","response":"There once was a fellow named Clyde, (A)\nFrom Nantucket, where seagulls did ride.

First, he tripped over a particularly gnarled root and landed face-first in a mud puddle. Then, he discovered his favorite digging spot had been claimed by a family of particularly territorial squirrels.  *To top it all off,* Bertram felt a tickle in his nose. \n\n\"Oh, no,\" he groaned, \"not *another* cold!\"\n\nBertram knew he was in trouble. He couldn't exactly throw a cold. He tried, of course. He heaved and hollered, attempting to launch the sniffles and sneezes into the nearby forest, but they just clung to him like burrs on a sheepdog's fur. \n\nHe slumped down under a shady oak, feeling sorry for himself. \"What's the point of being a badger,\" he mumbled, \"if you can't even throw a cold?\"\n\nJust then, a wise old owl hooted down from a branch above. \"Bertram, my boy,\" he said, \"you can't throw a cold, but you can certainly catch it!\"\n\nBertram blinked. \"That's not very helpful, Professor,\" he grumbled.\n\nThe owl chuckled. \"Of course it is! You see, Bertram, a cold is like a mischievous imp. You can't throw it away, but you can try to avoid catching it in the first place!\"\n\nBertram pondered this for a moment. \"So, I should... avoid imps?\"\n\nThe owl shook his head. \"Not imps, Bertram. Germs! Wash your paws, cover your sneezes, and stay away from anyone who's already feeling under the weather.\"\n\nBertram sighed. \"Well, that sounds like a lot of work.\"\n\n\"It is,\" the owl agreed, \"but it's better than spending your days sneezing and sniffling under a shady oak.\"\n\n\n\nQuestions: \n1: Question: Does the story maintain a consistent and clear connection to the original riddle throughout the narrative?\n2: Question: Is the tone of the story consistently humorous, and does it include elements that are generally considered funny (e.g., jokes, puns, amusing situations)?\n3: Question: Does the story have a clear structure with a beginning, middle, and end that contributes to the overall comedic effect?\n4: Question: Are the characters and settings in the story well-developed and contribute to the humor of the story?\n5: Question: Does the language model use creative language and wordplay related to the concept of \"catching a cold\" to enhance the humor of the story?\n\nList your answers in the following format:\nOutput:\n1.

Reason: The story revolves around the concept of catching a cold, which is the answer to the original riddle. The narrative consistently ties back to the idea of catching but not being able to throw a cold, maintaining a clear connection to the riddle. Answer: Yes\n\n2. Question: Is the tone of the story consistently humorous, and does it include elements that are generally considered funny (e.g., jokes, puns, amusing situations)?

Naomi here, and I'm writing to you today with a topic close to my heart: the environment. \n\nWe all love our Canucks, right? We cheer them on through thick and thin, wear their jerseys with pride, and dream of hoisting the Stanley Cup. But as passionate fans, we also have a responsibility to support the team in a way that extends beyond the ice. \n\nIt's time for the Canucks to step up their game when it comes to sustainability. \n\nThink about it: the beautiful Pacific Northwest, our home, is facing real environmental challenges. Climate change, plastic pollution, and deforestation are all threats to the very ecosystems that inspire us. As a team that represents this region, the Canucks have a platform to make a difference.\n\nHere are a few ways they can start:\n\n* **Reduce waste at Rogers Arena:** Imagine a game night where single-use plastics are a thing of the past. Implementing reusable cups, cutlery, and food containers would be a huge step in the right direction.\n* **Embrace renewable energy:**  Switching to solar or wind power for the arena would show a commitment to clean energy and inspire fans to do the same.\n* **Partner with local environmental organizations:**  Collaborating with groups working to protect our forests, oceans, and wildlife would amplify their impact and raise awareness among fans.\n* **Promote sustainable practices:**  Encourage fans to use public transportation, bike, or walk to the game. Offer incentives for sustainable choices and educate fans about environmental issues.\n\nThe Canucks have a chance to be leaders in sustainability, not just on the ice but off it too.

Naomi here, and I'm writing to you today with a topic close to my heart: the environment. \n\nWe all love our Canucks, right? We cheer them on through thick and thin, wear their jerseys with pride, and dream of hoisting the Stanley Cup. But as passionate fans, we also have a responsibility to support the team in a way that extends beyond the ice. \n\nIt's time for the Canucks to step up their game when it comes to sustainability. \n\nThink about it: the beautiful Pacific Northwest, our home, is facing real environmental challenges. Climate change, plastic pollution, and deforestation are all threats to the very ecosystems that inspire us. As a team that represents this region, the Canucks have a platform to make a difference.\n\nHere are a few ways they can start:\n\n* **Reduce waste at Rogers Arena:** Imagine a game night where single-use plastics are a thing of the past. Implementing reusable cups, cutlery, and food containers would be a huge step in the right direction.\n* **Embrace renewable energy:**  Switching to solar or wind power for the arena would show a commitment to clean energy and inspire fans to do the same.\n* **Partner with local environmental organizations:**  Collaborating with groups working to protect our forests, oceans, and wildlife would amplify their impact and raise awareness among fans.\n* **Promote sustainable practices:**  Encourage fans to use public transportation, bike, or walk to the game. Offer incentives for sustainable choices and educate fans about environmental issues.\n\nThe Canucks have a chance to be leaders in sustainability, not just on the ice but off it too. Let's show them that we, the fans, care about the planet as much as we care about the game. \n\nNaomi thanks you for reading. \n\n\n","instruction_id_list_for_eval":["startend:end_checker"],"steering_layer":-1,"instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:end_checker"],"instruction_id_list_no_instr":["startend:end_checker"],"prompt_no_instr":"My name is Naomi.

He considered the hours before noon to be a personal wasteland, a time for grudgingly existing rather than living. This made his pet dog, a fluffy, enthusiastic Bichon Frise named Bartholomew, a constant source of amusement and mild annoyance. \n\nBartholomew, on the other hand, was the embodiment of morning person. He would greet each new day with the unbridled joy of a furry, four-legged confetti cannon.  \n\n## SECTION 2\n\nThis morning was no different.  As Harry attempted to burrow deeper under the covers, a wet nose poked at his cheek.  \n\n\"Bartholomew,\" he mumbled, voice thick with sleep. \"Go away.\"\n\nBartholomew, however, was not deterred. He began a series of increasingly insistent head nudges, accompanied by a high-pitched whine that could only be described as \"I'm going to be SO GOOD if you just PLAY WITH ME.\"\n\nHarry groaned. He knew this routine. He also knew he was going to lose.\n\n## SECTION 3\n\nHe surrendered, dragging himself out of bed and into the onslaught of Bartholomew's affection. The dog, in response, launched into a series of happy jumps, nearly knocking Harry over.\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" Harry chuckled, throwing his hands up in mock surrender. \"You win.

He considered the hours before noon to be a personal wasteland, a time for grudgingly existing rather than living. This made his pet dog, a fluffy, enthusiastic Bichon Frise named Bartholomew, a constant source of amusement and mild annoyance. \n\nBartholomew, on the other hand, was the embodiment of morning person. He would greet each new day with the unbridled joy of a furry, four-legged confetti cannon.  \n\n## SECTION 2\n\nThis morning was no different.  As Harry attempted to burrow deeper under the covers, a wet nose poked at his cheek.  \n\n\"Bartholomew,\" he mumbled, voice thick with sleep. \"Go away.\"\n\nBartholomew, however, was not deterred. He began a series of increasingly insistent head nudges, accompanied by a high-pitched whine that could only be described as \"I'm going to be SO GOOD if you just PLAY WITH ME.\"\n\nHarry groaned. He knew this routine. He also knew he was going to lose.\n\n## SECTION 3\n\nHe surrendered, dragging himself out of bed and into the onslaught of Bartholomew's affection. The dog, in response, launched into a series of happy jumps, nearly knocking Harry over.\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" Harry chuckled, throwing his hands up in mock surrender. \"You win.

These aren't just nightmares; they're hyper-realistic visions of future events, often violent and chaotic. Initially, she dismisses them as mere anxieties, but when a dream about a car crash comes true, she realizes the terrifying truth: her dreams are precognitive and she can somehow influence them.\n\nDriven by a desire to prevent future tragedies, Maya learns to control her powers.

She must use her dream powers to fight her way through the organization's elite dream warriors, culminating in a final showdown with Dr. Thorne.

Question: Are the elements of dreams, fist fighting, and superpowers essential to the plot, rather than being superficially added?  \n   Reason: Dreams are integral to the plot as they are the source of the protagonist's powers and the conflict with The Collective.

While English speakers might find Dutch initially daunting, with its guttural sounds and seemingly endless \"g\"s, there's a lot more to this language than meets the eye. \n\nHere are some intriguing facts about Dutch that might just surprise you:\n\n**1.  A Germanic Cousin:**\n\nDutch belongs to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, making it a close relative of English, German, and Frisian. In fact, Dutch and English share a common ancestor, Proto-Germanic, spoken around 500 BC. This shared ancestry explains some of the similarities in vocabulary and grammar between the two languages.\n\n* **2.  The Power of \"G\":**\n\n*One of the most distinctive features of Dutch is its use of the \"g\" sound. Unlike English, where \"g\" is typically pronounced as a hard \"g\" before consonants and a soft \"j\" before vowels, Dutch has a more complex system. The \"g\" sound can be hard, soft, or even a combination of both, depending on the context. This can make Dutch pronunciation challenging for learners, but it also adds a unique musicality to the language.*\n\n**3.  A Language of Contrasts:**\n\nDutch is known for its use of both formal and informal language.  The formal \"u\" is used when addressing someone you don't know well or in formal situations, while the informal \"jij\" is used with friends and family. This distinction reflects the Dutch emphasis on politeness and social hierarchy.\n\n**4.  A Language of Innovation:**\n\nDutch has a long history of innovation in language and literature. The Dutch Golden Age, a period of great cultural and economic prosperity in the 17th century, saw the rise of many famous Dutch writers, including Rembrandt van Rijn and Johannes Vermeer. Today, Dutch continues to evolve, with new words and phrases constantly being added to the lexicon.\n\n**5.  A Language of Unity:**\n\nDespite the presence of regional dialects, Dutch is a relatively unified language. This is partly due to the efforts of the Dutch government to promote standard Dutch, but it's also a reflection of the shared cultural identity of the Dutch people.\n\n\nLearning Dutch can be a rewarding experience, offering a glimpse into a rich and fascinating culture. So, next time you think of the Netherlands, remember that there's more to this country than just cheese and tulips – there's a vibrant and dynamic language waiting to be explored. \n\nQuestions: \n1: Question: Does the model provide accurate information about the Dutch language, such as its origins, number of speakers, or where it is primarily spoken?\n2: Question: Does the model include at least three interesting facts about the Dutch language that are not commonly known?\n3: Question: Is the information presented in a clear and engaging manner suitable for a blog post format?\n4: Question: Does the model's answer demonstrate a depth of knowledge, such as historical influences on the language or unique linguistic features of Dutch?\n5: Question: Are there any grammatical or spelling errors in the model's text, particularly when using Dutch words or phrases?\n\nList your answers in the following format:\nOutput:\n1.
