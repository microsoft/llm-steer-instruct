I have been a loyal customer for several years, and I have always appreciated your commitment to customer satisfaction. However, I am writing to you today to address a concern that has left me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied.\n\nI recently purchased a [product name] from your online store, and upon receiving it, I discovered that it did not meet my expectations. I contacted your customer service department to request a refund, but unfortunately, my request was denied. I was informed that your company's policy does not allow for refunds on products that have been opened or used.\n\nI understand that your company has policies in place to protect your business, but I believe that this policy is unfair and unreasonable. I purchased the product with the expectation that it would meet my needs and that I would be satisfied with my purchase. However, I was disappointed to find that it did not meet my expectations, and I feel that I am entitled to a refund.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could review my case and reconsider your decision to deny my refund request. I believe that this is a fair request, and I hope that you will take the time to review my situation and make a decision that is in the best interest of your customers.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]", "follow_all_instructions": true}
