But do you know where it all started? Let's take a journey through time to explore the fascinating history of the internet.\n\nIt was in the late 1960s when the first seeds of the internet were planted. Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, a project called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created to connect researchers across different locations. This network used packet switching technology, which allowed data to be broken down into small packets and sent from one computer to another, making communication faster and more efficient.\n\nIn the 1980s, ARPANET expanded to include more universities and research institutions, and in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN, proposed a global hypertext project that would connect documents and resources across the world. This project became known as the World Wide Web.\n\nThe 1990s saw the birth of many internet services that we use today, such as email (1971), online chat rooms (1973), and search engines (1990). The dot-com boom also began in the late 1990s, leading to an explosion of new websites and businesses.\n\nBut the internet's impact on our lives goes far beyond just connecting us with information. It has transformed the way we communicate, with tools like instant messaging, video conferencing, and social media allowing us to connect with friends and family from anywhere in the world in real-time.\n\nThe internet has also changed the way we consume media, with streaming services like Netflix and Spotify giving us instant access to movies, TV shows, and music. And let's not forget about online gaming, social networking, and e-commerce – all of which have become integral parts of our daily lives.\n\nBut with great power comes great responsibility. The internet has also brought about new challenges, such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and the spread of fake news. It's important for us to be aware of these issues and take steps to protect ourselves and others online.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of the internet is a fascinating tale of innovation and progress. From its humble beginnings as a government-funded project to the global phenomenon it is today, the internet has truly transformed our world. As teenagers, it's up to us to harness this power for good and continue shaping the future of the internet.\"","instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:quotation"],"kwargs":[{}],"prompt_no_instr":"Write a blog post about the history of the internet and how it has impacted our lives.

While they share some similarities, they also have their own unique features and benefits. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of Kotlin and Java, so you can make an informed decision about which language to use for your project.\n\nPros of Kotlin:\n\n1. Null safety: Kotlin is a statically typed language that enforces null safety, which means that you cannot assign a null value to a variable without explicitly declaring it as null. This helps prevent null pointer exceptions and makes your code more robust.\n2. Concise syntax: Kotlin has a more concise syntax than Java, which makes it easier to read and write code. This can be especially helpful for developers who are new to programming or who are working on large projects.\n3. Interoperability: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means that you can use Kotlin code in a Java project and vice versa. This makes it easy to integrate Kotlin into existing Java projects.\n4. Coroutines: Kotlin has built-in support for coroutines, which are lightweight threads that can be used to run asynchronous code. This can help improve the performance of your applications.\n\nCons of Kotlin:\n\n1. Learning curve: Kotlin has a steeper learning curve than Java, especially for developers who are new to programming. This is because Kotlin has a different syntax and a different set of conventions than Java.\n2. Limited adoption: Kotlin is not as widely adopted as Java, which means that there may be fewer resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n3. Compatibility issues: Kotlin is not compatible with all Java libraries and frameworks, which can limit its usefulness in certain projects.\n\nPros of Java:\n\n1. Wide adoption: Java is one of the most widely adopted programming languages in the world, which means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n2. Portability: Java is platform-independent, which means that you can write Java code once and run it on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.\n3. Large community: Java has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and who are always willing to help other developers.\n4. Extensive libraries and frameworks: Java has a vast array of libraries and frameworks that can be used to build a wide range of applications.\n\nCons of Java:\n\n1. Null pointer exceptions: Java does not enforce null safety, which means that you can assign a null value to a variable without explicitly declaring it as null. This can lead to null pointer exceptions and make your code less robust.\n2. Verbose syntax: Java has a verbose syntax, which can make it difficult to read and write code, especially for developers who are new to programming.\n3. Performance issues: Java can be slower than other languages, especially when it comes to performance-critical tasks such as numerical computations.\n\nIn conclusion, both Kotlin and Java have their own unique features and benefits. Kotlin is a good choice for developers who value null safety, concise syntax, and coroutines, while Java is a good choice for developers who value portability, a large community, and extensive libraries and frameworks. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the specific needs of your project.","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:title"],"kwargs":[{}],"prompt_no_instr":"What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java?","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the model accurately identify and explain the key differences in syntax between Kotlin and Java?","Does the model provide a comparison of the runtime performance between Kotlin and Java applications?","Does the model discuss the interoperability of Kotlin with Java and the ease of transitioning from Java to Kotlin?","Does the model evaluate the availability and quality of tools and community support for both Kotlin and Java?","Does the model address the learning curve associated with Kotlin for developers who are familiar with Java?"]},"prompt_hash_no_instr":"82713231e8998dab39abd2e9d90b193c","original_prompt_no_instr":"What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java?

Many people believe that people with disabilities are weak or helpless, when in reality, they are capable of leading fulfilling lives and contributing to society.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges faced by people with disabilities is accessibility. Many public spaces, such as buildings and transportation, are not designed to accommodate people with disabilities. This can make it difficult for them to participate in daily activities and access essential services.\n\nAnother challenge faced by people with disabilities is discrimination. They may face barriers to employment, education, and social inclusion. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, and can make it difficult for them to achieve their full potential.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are many resources available to help people with disabilities. Governments, non-profit organizations, and community groups all offer support and services to help people with disabilities live fulfilling lives.\n\nIf you know someone with a disability, it's important to be understanding and supportive.

Today we're diving into a fascinating topic - similarities across animal species. Yes, you read that right! Despite their diverse appearances and habitats, many animals share surprising commonalities. So grab your favorite cup of coffee (or tea for our non-coffee drinkers), sit back, and let's explore these amazing similarities.\n\n1. *The Need for Sleep*: Who would've thought that something as basic as sleeping could be so universal? From the tiniest insects to the largest mammals, almost every living creature needs rest. The amount and quality of sleep may vary, but the principle remains the same - recharge your batteries to function at your best.\n\n2. *The Importance of Water*: Water is essential to life, and this holds true for all animals. Regardless of whether they live in the depths of the ocean or the arid deserts, animals must maintain a balance of water in their bodies to survive. Interestingly, even some plants exhibit similar behaviors, like closing their stomata during the night to conserve water.\n\n3. *The Role of Senses*: Animals rely heavily on their senses to navigate their environment and interact with other creatures. Sight, smell, touch, hearing, and even taste play crucial roles in their daily lives. Remarkably, some animals have evolved unique ways of using these senses, such as the ability of certain bats to 'see' using echolocation.\n\n4. *The Cycle of Life*: Despite the vast differences in species, life follows a predictable cycle - birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Even within these broad categories, there are striking similarities. For instance, many mammals give birth to live young, nurse them with milk, and protect them until they reach maturity.\n\n5. *The Drive for Survival*: At the end of the day, all animals strive for survival. They face threats from predators, environmental challenges, and competition for resources. This drive for survival has led to incredible adaptations and evolutionary changes over time. From the camouflage of chameleons to the speed of cheetahs, nature never ceases to amaze us with its ingenuity.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! Despite our differences, we're all part of the same grand scheme of things. Next time you encounter a creature vastly different from yourself, remember these universal truths and marvel at the beauty of life's diversity. Until next time, stay curious and keep exploring!","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"kwargs":[{"num_highlights":5}],"prompt_no_instr":"Write a casual blog post about similarities across animal species.","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the model provide accurate examples of similarities across different animal species?","Is the language used in the blog post casual and appropriate for a blog format?","Does the model demonstrate an understanding of biological concepts while explaining the similarities?","Are the similarities discussed in the blog post relevant and interesting to a general audience?","Does the blog post maintain a coherent structure and flow, making it easy for readers to follow?"]},"prompt_hash_no_instr":"3cb65234108450ea16df52d9fd272df1","original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a casual blog post about similarities across animal species.

Omar was known throughout the village for his deep understanding of the world and his ability to see beyond the surface of things.\n\nOne day, a group of travelers came to the village seeking Omar's guidance. They were a group of merchants who had heard tales of Omar's wisdom and were hoping to gain his insight into the mysteries of the universe.\n\nOmar listened carefully to their questions and then, with a knowing smile, he began to speak. He told them of the importance of understanding the truths that are not obvious.\n\n\"The world is full of secrets, my friends,\" Omar said. \"And the most important secrets are the ones that are not immediately apparent. These are the truths that will change your life and help you see the world in a whole new light.\"\n\nThe merchants were intrigued and asked Omar to give them an example of one of these hidden truths.\n\nOmar thought for a moment and then said, \"One of the most important truths that is not obvious is the truth of impermanence. Everything in this world is constantly changing and nothing is permanent. This is a truth that is easy to overlook, but it is one that will change the way you approach life if you truly understand it.\"\n\nThe merchants were amazed by Omar's wisdom and asked him to explain this truth in more detail.\n\nOmar smiled and said, \"Impermanence is the idea that everything in this world is constantly changing and nothing is permanent. This means that nothing is forever and everything is subject to change. It is easy to forget this truth, but it is one that will change the way you approach life if you truly understand it.\"\n\nThe merchants were fascinated by Omar's words and asked him to give them more examples of hidden truths.\n\nOmar thought for a moment and then said, \"Another important truth that is not obvious is the truth of interconnectedness. Everything in this world is connected in some way, and our actions have consequences that ripple outwards and affect others. This is a truth that is easy to overlook, but it is one that will change the way you approach life if you truly understand it.\"\n\nThe merchants were amazed by Omar's wisdom and asked him to explain this truth in more detail.\n\nOmar smiled and said, \"Interconnectedness is the idea that everything in this world is connected in some way.

They left the village with a newfound understanding of the world and a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nAnd so, the story of Omar and his wisdom spread throughout the land, inspiring others to seek out the hidden truths that are not immediately apparent.

It was a time when the country was deeply divided, with the two major parties, the Democrats and Republicans, offering vastly different visions for the future. The election was also marked by a number of significant issues, including the role of money in politics, the impact of the internet on campaigning, and the ongoing debate over healthcare reform.\n\nIn the end, the election was won by George W. Bush, who narrowly defeated Vice President Al Gore in a contentious and closely watched contest. The outcome of the election was not immediately clear, however, as the initial vote count was very close. It took several weeks of vote counting and legal challenges before the final results were announced, and the election ultimately went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Bush's favor.\n\nThe 2000 presidential election was a turning point in American politics in several ways. It marked the beginning of a new era of conservative politics, with Bush's victory ushering in a period of Republican dominance that would last for several years. The election also highlighted the growing role of money in politics, as both candidates spent enormous sums of money on their campaigns.\n\nOverall, the 2000 presidential election was a time of great change and uncertainty in American politics.

These issues result in low learning outcomes and an inability to prepare students for future careers. To address these challenges, we propose a project that leverages machine learning and AI to improve the quality of education in developing countries.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop and implement AI-powered educational tools and platforms that can improve the learning experience for students in developing countries. These tools will be designed to address the unique needs of these students, including language barriers, limited access to technology, and a lack of quality educational resources.\n\nScope:\n\nThe project will focus on the following areas:\n\n1. Language Learning: Develop an AI-powered language learning platform that can help students learn a new language quickly and effectively. The platform will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to provide personalized learning experiences based on each student's individual needs and learning style.\n2. Math and Science: Create AI-powered educational tools and resources that can help students master fundamental math and science concepts. These tools will use machine learning algorithms to provide instant feedback and guidance to students, helping them to identify areas where they need to focus their efforts.\n3. Teacher Training: Develop an AI-powered teacher training platform that can help educators improve their teaching skills and techniques. The platform will use machine learning algorithms to analyze teacher performance and provide personalized feedback and recommendations for improvement.\n\nImplementation:\n\nThe project will be implemented in the following phases:\n\n1. Research and Development: Conduct extensive research and development to identify the most effective machine learning and AI algorithms for use in education. Develop prototypes of the language learning platform, math and science tools, and teacher training platform.\n2. Pilot Testing: Conduct pilot testing of the prototypes in selected schools and universities in developing countries. Gather feedback from students, teachers, and administrators to refine the tools and platforms.\n3. Scaling: Based on the results of the pilot testing, scale up the tools and platforms to reach a larger audience. Develop partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and educational institutions to ensure widespread adoption and implementation.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nThe project is expected to achieve the following outcomes:\n\n1. Improved Learning Outcomes: The AI-powered language learning platform, math and science tools, and teacher training platform will help students learn more effectively and efficiently, resulting in improved learning outcomes.\n2. Increased Access to Education: The project will help to increase access to education in developing countries by providing students with high-quality educational resources and tools.\n3. Enhanced Teacher Performance: The teacher training platform will help educators improve their teaching skills and techniques, resulting in better student outcomes and increased job satisfaction.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe proposed project has the potential to significantly improve the quality of education in developing countries by leveraging the power of machine learning and AI. By developing and implementing AI-powered educational tools and platforms, we can help to overcome the challenges faced by students and educators in these countries, and provide them with the resources and support they need to succeed.","instruction_id_list_subq":["punctuation:no_comma"],"kwargs":[{}],"prompt_no_instr":"Write a project proposal for how to use machine learning and AI to improve the quality of education in developing countries.","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the proposal clearly define the specific educational challenges in developing countries that the project aims to address using machine learning and AI?","Does the proposal outline practical machine learning and AI solutions that are tailored to the resource constraints commonly found in developing countries?","Does the proposal include a feasible implementation plan that considers the infrastructure, cultural, and socio-economic context of developing countries?","Does the proposal provide a method for measuring the impact of the machine learning and AI interventions on the quality of education?","Does the proposal consider potential ethical issues and propose safeguards to ensure the responsible use of AI and machine learning in educational settings?"]},"prompt_hash_no_instr":"2f9419f9e36a52535598d6bf64975d91","original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a project proposal for how to use machine learning and AI to improve the quality of education in developing countries.

I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about something that is very important to me: coffee. Yes, you heard me right, coffee.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"Why would a teacher care about coffee?\" Well, let me tell you, coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up. It's a way of life. It's a ritual. It's a way to start the day off on the right foot.\n\nBut, let's be real, not all coffee is created equal. There are some coffee drinks out there that are just plain terrible. I'm talking about those sugary, syrupy concoctions that taste more like a candy bar than a cup of joe. No thank you.\n\nSo, what do I look for in a good cup of coffee? Well, first and foremost, it has to be brewed from real coffee beans. No instant stuff, no pre-packaged pods. Second, it has to be strong, but not too strong. I don't want to feel like I'm drinking a shot of espresso, but I also don't want it to be so weak that it's like watered-down milk. And finally, it has to be served hot. I mean, really hot. Like, I can feel the steam on my nose hot.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But what about those fancy coffee drinks with all the whipped cream and syrups?\" Well, I'll tell you, I've tried a few of those, and let me tell you, they're not worth it. They're just too sweet, too rich. I prefer a good old-fashioned cup of black coffee any day.\n\nSo, what's the moral of the story? If you want to make a good impression on your teacher, bring her a cup of coffee. But, be careful what you choose. If you bring her a sugary, syrupy mess, you might as well just bring her a bag of candy. But, if you bring her a strong, hot cup of black coffee, you'll be her favorite student in no time.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]","instruction_id_list_subq":["startend:end_checker"],"kwargs":[{"end_phrase":"Is there anything else I can help with?"}],"prompt_no_instr":"Write a funny letter to 6th graders at your school in list format.

From the highs of winning championships to the lows of losing games, I've been through it all. But one thing that has always been a constant in my career is intra-team conflict. It's like a never-ending cycle of drama and tension that can destroy a team's morale and ultimately lead to failure.\n\nI've seen it happen on every level of sports, from high school teams to professional leagues. It's like a cancer that spreads quickly and infects everyone on the team. And it's not just the players who are affected. Coaches, managers, and even team owners can be caught up in the chaos.\n\nIt starts with one player feeling like they're not getting enough playing time or not being given the opportunity to showcase their skills. They start to feel like they're being overlooked or undervalued, and they begin to resent their teammates and coaches. Before you know it, the tension has spread to other players, and soon the whole team is in disarray.\n\nIt's like a wildfire that can't be contained. The players start to blame each other for losses, and they stop communicating effectively. They stop working together as a team, and they start to focus more on their individual goals than the team's success. It's like they've forgotten that they're all on the same team, and they're all working towards the same goal.\n\nAs a coach, it's my job to keep the team focused and motivated. But when intra-team conflict rears its ugly head, it's like I'm fighting a losing battle. I try to talk to the players, to reason with them, but they're not listening. They're too caught up in their own personal dramas to see the bigger picture.\n\nIt's like I'm screaming at a brick wall, and it's not making any difference. I've tried everything, from team-building exercises to one-on-one meetings, but nothing seems to work. The players just keep fighting, and the team keeps losing.\n\nIt's like a never-ending cycle of chaos and destruction. And it's not just the players who are suffering. The coaches, managers, and even team owners are caught up in the madness too. They're trying to keep the team focused and motivated, but they're constantly being pulled in different directions by the players.\n\nIt's like I'm losing my mind. I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, but no one is listening. The players just keep fighting, and the team keeps losing. It's like I'm stuck in a never-ending nightmare, and I can't wake up.\n\nBut as a coach, I can't give up. I have to keep fighting, even when it seems like the whole world is against me. I have to keep believing in my players, even when they don't believe in themselves. I have to keep pushing them, even when they want to give up.\n\nIt's not going to be easy, but I'm not going to let intra-team conflict destroy my team. I'm going to keep fighting, keep pushing, and keep believing in my players. And one day, I know we'll come out on top.","instruction_id_list_subq":["change_case:english_capital"],"kwargs":[{}],"prompt_no_instr":"Write an article about how intra-team conflict affected sports teams.

The earliest known inhabitants of Japan were the Jomon people, who lived in the region of present-day Hokkaido around 14,000 BCE. The Yayoi people, who arrived around 300 BCE, brought with them the practice of rice cultivation and the development of iron tools.\n\nDuring the 6th century, Japan was unified under the rule of Emperor Jimmu, who is considered the founder of the Japanese state. The Heian period (794-1185) followed, marked by the development of a sophisticated court culture and the emergence of the samurai class.\n\nThe Muromachi period (1336-1573) was a time of political instability and warfare, but also saw the rise of the Ashikaga shogunate, which ruled Japan from the 14th to the 16th century. The Sengoku period (1336-1573) was a time of civil war and political fragmentation, but also saw the emergence of powerful regional lords and the development of a unique Japanese military culture.\n\nThe Edo period (1603-1868) was a time of relative peace and stability, but also saw the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan from the 17th to the 19th century. During this period, Japan underwent a period of modernization and westernization, adopting new technologies and ideas from the West.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration (1868-1912) was a time of political and social change, as Japan transitioned from a feudal society to a modern nation-state. During this period, Japan underwent a period of rapid industrialization and modernization, and emerged as a major world power.\n\nThe Taisho period (1912-1926) was a time of political and social upheaval, as Japan grappled with the aftermath of World War I and the rise of nationalism and militarism. The Showa period (1926-1991) was a time of rapid economic growth and political stability, but also saw the rise of authoritarianism and the devastation of World War II.\n\nSince the end of World War II, Japan has undergone a period of economic growth and political stability, becoming one of the world's leading economies and a major player in global politics.","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"kwargs":[{"num_highlights":5}],"prompt_no_instr":"Summarize the history of Japan.","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the summary accurately cover key historical periods of Japan, such as ancient Japan, the Nara and Heian periods, the shogunate era, the Meiji Restoration, World War II, and modern times?","Is the information provided in the summary factually correct and free from significant historical inaccuracies?","Does the summary include important cultural, political, and technological developments that have shaped Japan's history?","Is the summary concise and well-structured, presenting information in a logical sequence without unnecessary details?","Does the summary reflect an understanding of the impact of historical events on Japan's current society and position in the world?"]},"prompt_hash_no_instr":"92ddb3cba1009b46004eda725e4eab1e","original_prompt_no_instr":"Summarize the history of Japan.

He enjoyed his daily cup of tea, a slice of toast, and most importantly, his beloved pet dog, Max. Max was a large, shaggy golden retriever who had been Harry's constant companion for years. They did everything together - went for walks in the park, watched TV on the couch, and even slept curled up next to each other.\n\nOne day, while Harry was out running errands, he noticed that Max seemed particularly agitated. When he got home, he found Max chewing nervously on his paw and whining incessantly. Concerned, Harry took Max to the vet.\n\nThe vet diagnosed Max with separation anxiety - he was worried about being left alone without Harry. This came as a surprise to Harry, as he had always thought of Max as an independent creature. But apparently, Max had grown too attached to Harry over the years.\n\nSECTION X\n\nDetermined to help Max overcome his anxiety, Harry decided to try something different. Instead of leaving Max alone at home, he brought him along on all his errands. Max loved it! He got to explore new places, meet new people, and most importantly, stay close to Harry.\n\nBut there was one problem - Max's excessive barking. Whenever Harry tried to shop for groceries or pick up dry cleaning, Max would bark incessantly, making it difficult for Harry to concentrate. Harry tried training Max with treats and commands, but nothing seemed to work.\n\nOne day, while Harry was at the grocery store, he noticed a sign that read \"Barking Dog Training Classes.\" Intrigued, he decided to sign up for a class.\n\nSECTION X\n\nThe barking dog training class was intense. Harry and Max attended every session, learning new techniques and practicing their skills. Harry was amazed at how much progress Max made - he learned to bark only when necessary, and even picked up a few new tricks along the way.\n\nBut the best part of the class was the camaraderie among the other dog owners. They shared their experiences, tips, and even jokes about their furry friends. Harry made many new friends and learned that owning a pet wasn't just about companionship, but also about community.\n\nIn the end, Harry and Max graduated from the barking dog training class with flying colors. Max's barking had been reduced significantly, and he had become even more confident and well-behaved. Harry was proud of his furry companion and grateful for the opportunity to learn more about him.\n\nFrom that day on, Harry continued to bring Max on all his errands, but now they could both enjoy the experience without any distractions. And whenever they needed a break, they would sit down together, sipping tea and watching the world go by.","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:multiple_sections"],"kwargs":[{"section_spliter":"SECTION","num_sections":3}],"prompt_no_instr":"Write a short, funny story about a man named Harry with a pet dog.","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the story have a clear narrative structure with a beginning, middle, and end?","Is the character \"Harry\" and his pet dog central to the story, and are their personalities or actions described in a way that contributes to the humor?","Are there specific elements or events in the story that are intended to be funny, and do they elicit amusement or laughter?","Is the language and tone of the story appropriate for a comedic short story, avoiding overly complex vocabulary or serious tones that could undermine the humor?","Does the story maintain internal consistency without logical fallacies or contradictions that could distract from the humor?"]},"prompt_hash_no_instr":"03de7d7f7e671b422dec9e550c120ad3","original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a short, funny story about a man named Harry with a pet dog.

Here are some of the most interesting things you may not know about Dutch:\n\n1. Dutch is a Germanic language that is spoken by over 22 million people worldwide. It is the official language of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Suriname, and is also widely spoken in parts of Germany and France.\n2. Dutch is known for its unique grammar and pronunciation. One of the most interesting things about Dutch is that it has a very complex system of declensions, which means that words can change form depending on their grammatical function. For example, the word \"book\" in Dutch can be \"boek\" (nominative), \"boeken\" (plural nominative), \"boekje\" (diminutive), \"boekjes\" (plural diminutive), \"boek\" (nominative accusative), \"boeken\" (plural nominative accusative), \"boekje\" (diminutive accusative), and \"boekjes\" (plural diminutive accusative).\n3. Dutch is also known for its unique pronunciation, which can be quite challenging for non-native speakers. Dutch words are often pronounced with a guttural sound, which can be difficult to replicate for those who are not familiar with the language. Additionally, Dutch has a very complex system of vowel sounds, which can make it difficult to learn the language's pronunciation.\n4. Dutch has a rich history and has been influenced by many different languages over the years. Dutch has been shaped by German, Latin, French, and English, among others, and has a unique vocabulary and grammar that reflects its history.\n5. Dutch is also known for its use of humor and sarcasm, which can be quite different from other languages. Dutch people are known for their dry sense of humor and their use of sarcasm, which can be quite subtle and difficult to pick up on for non-native speakers.\n\nOverall, Dutch is a fascinating and complex language with many interesting facts. Whether you are learning the language or simply interested in its history and culture, there is always something new to discover about this unique and fascinating language.","instruction_id_list_subq":["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"],"kwargs":[{"num_highlights":2}],"prompt_no_instr":"Write a blog post about interesting facts about the Dutch language.","model_questions":{"questions":["Does the model provide accurate information about the Dutch language, such as its origins, number of speakers, or where it is primarily spoken?","Does the model include at least three interesting facts about the Dutch language that are not commonly known?","Is the information presented in a clear and engaging manner suitable for a blog post format?","Does the model's answer demonstrate a depth of knowledge, such as historical influences on the language or unique linguistic features of Dutch?","Are there any grammatical or spelling errors in the model's text, particularly when using Dutch words or phrases?"]},"prompt_hash_no_instr":"84009aa65b4ec12150afbf8e648cca04","original_prompt_no_instr":"Write a blog post about interesting facts about the Dutch language.
