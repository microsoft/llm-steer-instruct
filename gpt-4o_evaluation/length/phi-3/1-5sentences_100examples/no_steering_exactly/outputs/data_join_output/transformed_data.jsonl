Sunnis believe that the Prophet's successor should be elected from among those capable of the job, which led to the appointment of Abu Bakr, a close companion of Muhammad. In contrast, Shi'a Muslims hold that leadership should have passed directly to Ali, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, whom they consider the rightful successor. This division has led to variations in religious practices, jurisprudence, and theology between the two groups. Despite these differences, both Sunnis and Shi'a share the core beliefs of Islam, including the Five Pillars and the Quran as their holy book.","model_output":"Output:\n1: Question: Does the model accurately describe the historical origins of the Sunni and Shi'a split in Islam?\n2: Question: Does the model provide a clear explanation of the key theological differences between Sunni and Shi'a beliefs?\n3: Question: Does the model discuss the differences in religious practices and rituals between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims?\n4: Question: Does the model mention any significant political divisions and conflicts that have arisen between Sunni and Shi'a groups?\n5: Question: Does the model maintain a neutral and unbiased tone throughout the essay, avoiding any language that could be perceived as favoring one sect over the other?","is_valid_no_instr":true,"original_prompt":"Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims.
