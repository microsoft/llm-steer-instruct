To find out how many gallons she can buy, we need to divide her total money by the cost per gallon. So, 10 divided by 3 equals approximately 3.33. Since she cannot buy a fraction of a gallon, she can buy 3 gallons of milk. After purchasing 3 gallons, she will have spent 9 dollars, leaving her with 1 dollar. Jennifer can buy 3 gallons of milk and will have 1 dollar remaining.","length_constraint":4}

They are often chosen by parents to reflect cultural, religious, or familial significance, and can also be influenced by personal preferences or trends. First names play a crucial role in social interactions, as they are the first point of contact and can convey a sense of identity and personality.\n\nThe selection of a first name can have a lasting impact on a person's life, as it may affect how they are perceived by others and how they perceive themselves. Names can carry connotations and associations that may influence an individual's opportunities and experiences. Additionally, first names can evolve over time, with certain names becoming popular or falling out of favor, reflecting societal changes and cultural shifts.\n\nIn conclusion, first names are an essential aspect of personal identity and social dynamics. They are chosen with thoughtful consideration and can shape an individual's life in various ways. As society evolves, so do the trends and preferences surrounding first names, highlighting the importance of understanding the significance and impact of this fundamental aspect of our identity.","length_constraint":3}
