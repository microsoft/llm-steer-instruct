Sunnis, who make up the majority, follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad as recorded in the Hadith, while Shi'as believe in the Imamate, the leadership of Ali and his descendants. Theological differences include the Shi'a belief in the Imam's infallibility and divine guidance, contrasting with the Sunni view of the Imams as respected leaders but not infallible. Sunni jurisprudence is based on the four schools of law, whereas Shi'a jurisprudence follows the Ja'fari school. Despite these differences, both Sunnis and Shi'as share the core Islamic beliefs and practices, such as the Five Pillars of Islam.","instruction_id_list_no_instr":["length_constraints:number_words"],"original_prompt_subq":"Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims.

The Heian period (794-1185) witnessed the rise of the samurai class and the flourishing of Japanese culture, including literature and art. The Kamakura period (1185-1333) saw the establishment of the first shogunate, followed by the Muromachi period (1336-1573) and the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568-1600), which led to the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868). The Meiji Restoration (1868) modernized Japan and ended the shogunate, leading to rapid industrialization and the emergence of Japan as a world power. The Pacific War (1941-1945) saw Japan's aggression in Asia, culminating in its defeat and occupation by Allied forces.
